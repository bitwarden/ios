This project uses Fastlane's Deliver tool to manage App Store metadata. Localized metadata is stored in subdirectories under:

fastlane/metadata_bwa_prod
fastlane/metadata_bwpm_prod

Inside each locale directory, youâ€™ll find text files for default metadata like description.txt, keywords.txt, and release_notes.txt that are used during App Store submissions.

ðŸ’¡ These directories are read automatically by deliver during metadata upload and should be kept in sync when marketing content is updated.

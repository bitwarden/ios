# Adding tags to tests

Use tags to provide semantic information for organization, filtering, and customizing appearances.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/addingtags\#Overview)

A complex package or project may contain hundreds or thousands of tests and suites. Some subset of those tests may share some common facet, such as being _critical_ or _flaky_. The testing library includes a type of trait called _tags_ that you can add to group and categorize tests.

Tags are different from test suites: test suites impose structure on test functions at the source level, while tags provide semantic information for a test that can be shared with any number of other tests across test suites, source files, and even test targets.

## [Add a tag](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/addingtags\#Add-a-tag)

To add a tag to a test, use the [`tags(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/tags(_:)) trait. This trait takes a sequence of tags as its argument, and those tags are then applied to the corresponding test at runtime. If any tags are applied to a test suite, then all tests in that suite inherit those tags.

The testing library doesn’t assign any semantic meaning to any tags, nor does the presence or absence of tags affect how the testing library runs tests.

Tags themselves are instances of [`Tag`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/tag) and expressed as named constants declared as static members of [`Tag`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/tag). To declare a named constant tag, use the [`Tag()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/tag()) macro:

```
extension Tag {
  @Tag static var legallyRequired: Self
}

@Test("Vendor's license is valid", .tags(.legallyRequired))
func licenseValid() { ... }

```

If two tags with the same name ( `legallyRequired` in the above example) are declared in different files, modules, or other contexts, the testing library treats them as equivalent.

If it’s important for a tag to be distinguished from similar tags declared elsewhere in a package or project (or its dependencies), use reverse-DNS naming to create a unique Swift symbol name for your tag:

```
extension Tag {
  enum com_example_foodtruck {}
}

extension Tag.com_example_foodtruck {
  @Tag static var extraSpecial: Tag
}

@Test(
  "Extra Special Sauce recipe is secret",
  .tags(.com_example_foodtruck.extraSpecial)
)
func secretSauce() { ... }

```

### [Where tags can be declared](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/addingtags\#Where-tags-can-be-declared)

Tags must always be declared as members of [`Tag`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/tag) in an extension to that type or in a type nested within [`Tag`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/tag). Redeclaring a tag under a second name has no effect and the additional name will not be recognized by the testing library. The following example is unsupported:

```
extension Tag {
  @Tag static var legallyRequired: Self // ✅ OK: Declaring a new tag.

  static var requiredByLaw: Self { // ❌ ERROR: This tag name isn't
                                   // recognized at runtime.
    legallyRequired
  }
}

```

If a tag is declared as a named constant outside of an extension to the [`Tag`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/tag) type (for example, at the root of a file or in another unrelated type declaration), it cannot be applied to test functions or test suites. The following declarations are unsupported:

```
@Tag let needsKetchup: Self // ❌ ERROR: Tags must be declared in an extension
                            // to Tag.
struct Food {
  @Tag var needsMustard: Self // ❌ ERROR: Tags must be declared in an extension
                              // to Tag.
}

```

# Adding comments to tests

Add comments to provide useful information about tests.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/addingcomments\#Overview)

It’s often useful to add comments to code to:

- Provide context or background information about the code’s purpose

- Explain how complex code implemented

- Include details which may be helpful when diagnosing issues


Test code is no different and can benefit from explanatory code comments, but often test issues are shown in places where the source code of the test is unavailable such as in continuous integration (CI) interfaces or in log files.

Seeing comments related to tests in these contexts can help diagnose issues more quickly. Comments can be added to test declarations and the testing library will automatically capture and show them when issues are recorded.

## [Add a code comment to a test](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/addingcomments\#Add-a-code-comment-to-a-test)

To include a comment on a test or suite, write an ordinary Swift code comment immediately before its `@Test` or `@Suite` attribute:

```
// Assumes the standard lunch menu includes a taco
@Test func lunchMenu() {
  let foodTruck = FoodTruck(
    menu: .lunch,
    ingredients: [.tortillas, .cheese]
  )
  #expect(foodTruck.menu.contains { $0 is Taco })
}

```

The comment, `// Assumes the standard lunch menu includes a taco`, is added to the test.

The following language comment styles are supported:

| Syntax | Style |
| --- | --- |
| `// ...` | Line comment |
| `/// ...` | Documentation line comment |
| `/* ... */` | Block comment |
| `/** ... */` | Documentation block comment |

### [Comment formatting](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/addingcomments\#Comment-formatting)

Test comments which are automatically added from source code comments preserve their original formatting, including any prefixes like `//` or `/**`. This is because the whitespace and formatting of comments can be meaningful in some circumstances or aid in understanding the comment — for example, when a comment includes an example code snippet or diagram.

## [Use test comments effectively](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/addingcomments\#Use-test-comments-effectively)

As in normal code, comments on tests are generally most useful when they:

- Add information that isn’t obvious from reading the code

- Provide useful information about the operation or motivation of a test


If a test is related to a bug or issue, consider using the [`Bug`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/bug) trait instead of comments. For more information, see [Associating bugs with tests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/associatingbugs).

# Organizing test functions with suite types

Organize tests into test suites.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests\#Overview)

When working with a large selection of test functions, it can be helpful to organize them into test suites.

A test function can be added to a test suite in one of two ways:

- By placing it in a Swift type.

- By placing it in a Swift type and annotating that type with the `@Suite` attribute.


The `@Suite` attribute isn’t required for the testing library to recognize that a type contains test functions, but adding it allows customization of a test suite’s appearance in the IDE and at the command line. If a trait such as [`tags(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/tags(_:)) or [`disabled(_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/disabled(_:sourcelocation:)) is applied to a test suite, it’s automatically inherited by the tests contained in the suite.

In addition to containing test functions and any other members that a Swift type might contain, test suite types can also contain additional test suites nested within them. To add a nested test suite type, simply declare an additional type within the scope of the outer test suite type.

By default, tests contained within a suite run in parallel with each other. For more information about test parallelization, see [Running tests serially or in parallel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelization).

### [Customize a suite’s name](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests\#Customize-a-suites-name)

To customize a test suite’s name, supply a string literal as an argument to the `@Suite` attribute:

```
@Suite("Food truck tests") struct FoodTruckTests {
  @Test func foodTruckExists() { ... }
}

```

To further customize the appearance and behavior of a test function, use [traits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/traits) such as [`tags(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/tags(_:)).

## [Test functions in test suite types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests\#Test-functions-in-test-suite-types)

If a type contains a test function declared as an instance method (that is, without either the `static` or `class` keyword), the testing library calls that test function at runtime by initializing an instance of the type, then calling the test function on that instance. If a test suite type contains multiple test functions declared as instance methods, each one is called on a distinct instance of the type. Therefore, the following test suite and test function:

```
@Suite struct FoodTruckTests {
  @Test func foodTruckExists() { ... }
}

```

Are equivalent to:

```
@Suite struct FoodTruckTests {
  func foodTruckExists() { ... }

  @Test static func staticFoodTruckExists() {
    let instance = FoodTruckTests()
    instance.foodTruckExists()
  }
}

```

### [Constraints on test suite types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests\#Constraints-on-test-suite-types)

When using a type as a test suite, it’s subject to some constraints that are not otherwise applied to Swift types.

#### [An initializer may be required](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests\#An-initializer-may-be-required)

If a type contains test functions declared as instance methods, it must be possible to initialize an instance of the type with a zero-argument initializer. The initializer may be any combination of:

- implicit or explicit

- synchronous or asynchronous

- throwing or non-throwing

- `private`, `fileprivate`, `internal`, `package`, or `public`


For example:

```
@Suite struct FoodTruckTests {
  var batteryLevel = 100

  @Test func foodTruckExists() { ... } // ✅ OK: The type has an implicit init().
}

@Suite struct CashRegisterTests {
  private init(cashOnHand: Decimal = 0.0) async throws { ... }

  @Test func calculateSalesTax() { ... } // ✅ OK: The type has a callable init().
}

struct MenuTests {
  var foods: [Food]
  var prices: [Food: Decimal]

  @Test static func specialOfTheDay() { ... } // ✅ OK: The function is static.
  @Test func orderAllFoods() { ... } // ❌ ERROR: The suite type requires init().
}

```

The compiler emits an error when presented with a test suite that doesn’t meet this requirement.

### [Test suite types must always be available](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests\#Test-suite-types-must-always-be-available)

Although `@available` can be applied to a test function to limit its availability at runtime, a test suite type (and any types that contain it) must _not_ be annotated with the `@available` attribute:

```
@Suite struct FoodTruckTests { ... } // ✅ OK: The type is always available.

@available(macOS 11.0, *) // ❌ ERROR: The suite type must always be available.
@Suite struct CashRegisterTests { ... }

@available(macOS 11.0, *) struct MenuItemTests { // ❌ ERROR: The suite type's
                                                 // containing type must always
                                                 // be available too.
  @Suite struct BurgerTests { ... }
}

```

The compiler emits an error when presented with a test suite that doesn’t meet this requirement.

# CustomTestArgumentEncodable

A protocol for customizing how arguments passed to parameterized tests are encoded, which is used to match against when running specific arguments.

## [Mentioned in](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customtestargumentencodable\#mentions)

[Implementing parameterized tests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting)

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customtestargumentencodable\#overview)

The testing library checks whether a test argument conforms to this protocol, or any of several other known protocols, when running selected test cases. When a test argument conforms to this protocol, that conformance takes highest priority, and the testing library will then call [`encodeTestArgument(to:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customtestargumentencodable/encodetestargument(to:)) on the argument. A type that conforms to this protocol is not required to conform to either `Encodable` or `Decodable`.

See [Implementing parameterized tests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting) for a list of the other supported ways to allow running selected test cases.

## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customtestargumentencodable\#topics)

# Defining test functions

Define a test function to validate that code is working correctly.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/definingtests\#Overview)

Defining a test function for a Swift package or project is straightforward.

### [Import the testing library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/definingtests\#Import-the-testing-library)

To import the testing library, add the following to the Swift source file that contains the test:

```
import Testing

```

### [Declare a test function](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/definingtests\#Declare-a-test-function)

To declare a test function, write a Swift function declaration that doesn’t take any arguments, then prefix its name with the `@Test` attribute:

```
@Test func foodTruckExists() {
  // Test logic goes here.
}

```

This test function can be present at file scope or within a type. A type containing test functions is automatically a _test suite_ and can be optionally annotated with the `@Suite` attribute. For more information about suites, see [Organizing test functions with suite types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests).

Note that, while this function is a valid test function, it doesn’t actually perform any action or test any code. To check for expected values and outcomes in test functions, add [expectations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expectations) to the test function.

### [Customize a test’s name](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/definingtests\#Customize-a-tests-name)

To customize a test function’s name as presented in an IDE or at the command line, supply a string literal as an argument to the `@Test` attribute:

```
@Test("Food truck exists") func foodTruckExists() { ... }

```

To further customize the appearance and behavior of a test function, use [traits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/traits) such as [`tags(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/tags(_:)).

### [Write concurrent or throwing tests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/definingtests\#Write-concurrent-or-throwing-tests)

As with other Swift functions, test functions can be marked `async` and `throws` to annotate them as concurrent or throwing, respectively. If a test is only safe to run in the main actor’s execution context (that is, from the main thread of the process), it can be annotated `@MainActor`:

```
@Test @MainActor func foodTruckExists() async throws { ... }

```

### [Limit the availability of a test](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/definingtests\#Limit-the-availability-of-a-test)

If a test function can only run on newer versions of an operating system or of the Swift language, use the `@available` attribute when declaring it. Use the `message` argument of the `@available` attribute to specify a message to log if a test is unable to run due to limited availability:

```
@available(macOS 11.0, *)
@available(swift, introduced: 8.0, message: "Requires Swift 8.0 features to run")
@Test func foodTruckExists() { ... }

```

# Interpreting bug identifiers

Examine how the testing library interprets bug identifiers provided by developers.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/bugidentifiers\#Overview)

The testing library supports two distinct ways to identify a bug:

1. A URL linking to more information about the bug; and

2. A unique identifier in the bug’s associated bug-tracking system.


A bug may have both an associated URL _and_ an associated unique identifier. It must have at least one or the other in order for the testing library to be able to interpret it correctly.

To create an instance of [`Bug`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/bug) with a URL, use the [`bug(_:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:_:)) trait. At compile time, the testing library will validate that the given string can be parsed as a URL according to [RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt).

To create an instance of [`Bug`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/bug) with a bug’s unique identifier, use the [`bug(_:id:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:id:_:)-10yf5) trait. The testing library does not require that a bug’s unique identifier match any particular format, but will interpret unique identifiers starting with `"FB"` as referring to bugs tracked with the [Apple Feedback Assistant](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/). For convenience, you can also directly pass an integer as a bug’s identifier using [`bug(_:id:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:id:_:)-3vtpl).

### [Examples](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/bugidentifiers\#Examples)

| Trait Function | Inferred Bug-Tracking System |
| --- | --- |
| `.bug(id: 12345)` | None |
| `.bug(id: "12345")` | None |
| `.bug("https://www.example.com?id=12345", id: "12345")` | None |
| `.bug("https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/pull/12345")` | [GitHub Issues for the Swift project](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/issues) |
| `.bug("https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12345")` | [WebKit Bugzilla](https://bugs.webkit.org/) |

# Limiting the running time of tests

Set limits on how long a test can run for until it fails.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/limitingexecutiontime\#Overview)

Some tests may naturally run slowly: they may require significant system resources to complete, may rely on downloaded data from a server, or may otherwise be dependent on external factors.

If a test may hang indefinitely or may consume too many system resources to complete effectively, consider setting a time limit for it so that it’s marked as failing if it runs for an excessive amount of time. Use the [`timeLimit(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/timelimit(_:)) trait as an upper bound:

```
@Test(.timeLimit(.minutes(60))
func serve100CustomersInOneHour() async {
  for _ in 0 ..< 100 {
    let customer = await Customer.next()
    await customer.order()
    ...
  }
}

```

If the above test function takes longer than an hour (60 x 60 seconds) to execute, the task in which it’s running is [cancelled](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task/cancel()) and the test fails with an issue of kind [`Issue.Kind.timeLimitExceeded(timeLimitComponents:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/issue/kind-swift.enum/timelimitexceeded(timelimitcomponents:)).

The testing library may adjust the specified time limit for performance reasons or to ensure tests have enough time to run. In particular, a granularity of (by default) one minute is applied to tests. The testing library can also be configured with a maximum time limit per test that overrides any applied time limit traits.

### [Time limits applied to test suites](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/limitingexecutiontime\#Time-limits-applied-to-test-suites)

When a time limit is applied to a test suite, it’s recursively applied to all test functions and child test suites within that suite.

### [Time limits applied to parameterized tests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/limitingexecutiontime\#Time-limits-applied-to-parameterized-tests)

When a time limit is applied to a parameterized test function, it’s applied to each invocation _separately_ so that if only some arguments cause failures, then successful arguments aren’t incorrectly marked as failing too.

# Implementing parameterized tests

Specify different input parameters to generate multiple test cases from a test function.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting\#Overview)

Some tests need to be run over many different inputs. For instance, a test might need to validate all cases of an enumeration. The testing library lets developers specify one or more collections to iterate over during testing, with the elements of those collections being forwarded to a test function. An invocation of a test function with a particular set of argument values is called a test _case_.

By default, the test cases of a test function run in parallel with each other. For more information about test parallelization, see [Running tests serially or in parallel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelization).

### [Parameterize over an array of values](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting\#Parameterize-over-an-array-of-values)

It is very common to want to run a test _n_ times over an array containing the values that should be tested. Consider the following test function:

```
enum Food {
  case burger, iceCream, burrito, noodleBowl, kebab
}

@Test("All foods available")
func foodsAvailable() async throws {
  for food: Food in [.burger, .iceCream, .burrito, .noodleBowl, .kebab] {
    let foodTruck = FoodTruck(selling: food)
    #expect(await foodTruck.cook(food))
  }
}

```

If this test function fails for one of the values in the array, it may be unclear which value failed. Instead, the test function can be _parameterized over_ the various inputs:

```
enum Food {
  case burger, iceCream, burrito, noodleBowl, kebab
}

@Test("All foods available", arguments: [Food.burger, .iceCream, .burrito, .noodleBowl, .kebab])
func foodAvailable(_ food: Food) async throws {
  let foodTruck = FoodTruck(selling: food)
  #expect(await foodTruck.cook(food))
}

```

When passing a collection to the `@Test` attribute for parameterization, the testing library passes each element in the collection, one at a time, to the test function as its first (and only) argument. Then, if the test fails for one or more inputs, the corresponding diagnostics can clearly indicate which inputs to examine.

### [Parameterize over the cases of an enumeration](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting\#Parameterize-over-the-cases-of-an-enumeration)

The previous example includes a hard-coded list of `Food` cases to test. If `Food` is an enumeration that conforms to `CaseIterable`, you can instead write:

```
enum Food: CaseIterable {
  case burger, iceCream, burrito, noodleBowl, kebab
}

@Test("All foods available", arguments: Food.allCases)
func foodAvailable(_ food: Food) async throws {
  let foodTruck = FoodTruck(selling: food)
  #expect(await foodTruck.cook(food))
}

```

This way, if a new case is added to the `Food` enumeration, it’s automatically tested by this function.

### [Parameterize over a range of integers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting\#Parameterize-over-a-range-of-integers)

It is possible to parameterize a test function over a closed range of integers:

```
@Test("Can make large orders", arguments: 1 ... 100)
func makeLargeOrder(count: Int) async throws {
  let foodTruck = FoodTruck(selling: .burger)
  #expect(await foodTruck.cook(.burger, quantity: count))
}

```

### [Test with more than one collection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting\#Test-with-more-than-one-collection)

It’s possible to test more than one collection. Consider the following test function:

```
@Test("Can make large orders", arguments: Food.allCases, 1 ... 100)
func makeLargeOrder(of food: Food, count: Int) async throws {
  let foodTruck = FoodTruck(selling: food)
  #expect(await foodTruck.cook(food, quantity: count))
}

```

Elements from the first collection are passed as the first argument to the test function, elements from the second collection are passed as the second argument, and so forth.

Assuming there are five cases in the `Food` enumeration, this test function will, when run, be invoked 500 times (5 x 100) with every possible combination of food and order size. These combinations are referred to as the collections’ Cartesian product.

To avoid the combinatoric semantics shown above, use [`zip()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/zip(_:_:)):

```
@Test("Can make large orders", arguments: zip(Food.allCases, 1 ... 100))
func makeLargeOrder(of food: Food, count: Int) async throws {
  let foodTruck = FoodTruck(selling: food)
  #expect(await foodTruck.cook(food, quantity: count))
}

```

The zipped sequence will be “destructured” into two arguments automatically, then passed to the test function for evaluation.

This revised test function is invoked once for each tuple in the zipped sequence, for a total of five invocations instead of 500 invocations. In other words, this test function is passed the inputs `(.burger, 1)`, `(.iceCream, 2)`, …, `(.kebab, 5)` instead of `(.burger, 1)`, `(.burger, 2)`, `(.burger, 3)`, …, `(.kebab, 99)`, `(.kebab, 100)`.

### [Run selected test cases](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting\#Run-selected-test-cases)

If a parameterized test meets certain requirements, the testing library allows people to run specific test cases it contains. This can be useful when a test has many cases but only some are failing since it enables re-running and debugging the failing cases in isolation.

To support running selected test cases, it must be possible to deterministically match the test case’s arguments. When someone attempts to run selected test cases of a parameterized test function, the testing library evaluates each argument of the tests’ cases for conformance to one of several known protocols, and if all arguments of a test case conform to one of those protocols, that test case can be run selectively. The following lists the known protocols, in precedence order (highest to lowest):

1. [`CustomTestArgumentEncodable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customtestargumentencodable)

2. `RawRepresentable`, where `RawValue` conforms to `Encodable`

3. `Encodable`

4. `Identifiable`, where `ID` conforms to `Encodable`


If any argument of a test case doesn’t meet one of the above requirements, then the overall test case cannot be run selectively.

Protocol

# CustomTestStringConvertible

A protocol describing types with a custom string representation when presented as part of a test’s output.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalystmacOStvOSvisionOSwatchOSSwift 6.0+Xcode 16.0+

```
protocol CustomTestStringConvertible
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customteststringconvertible\#overview)

Values whose types conform to this protocol use it to describe themselves when they are present as part of the output of a test. For example, this protocol affects the display of values that are passed as arguments to test functions or that are elements of an expectation failure.

By default, the testing library converts values to strings using `String(describing:)`. The resulting string may be inappropriate for some types and their values. If the type of the value is made to conform to [`CustomTestStringConvertible`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customteststringconvertible), then the value of its [`testDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customteststringconvertible/testdescription) property will be used instead.

For example, consider the following type:

```
enum Food: CaseIterable {
  case paella, oden, ragu
}

```

If an array of cases from this enumeration is passed to a parameterized test function:

```
@Test(arguments: Food.allCases)
func isDelicious(_ food: Food) { ... }

```

Then the values in the array need to be presented in the test output, but the default description of a value may not be adequately descriptive:

```
◇ Passing argument food → .paella to isDelicious(_:)
◇ Passing argument food → .oden to isDelicious(_:)
◇ Passing argument food → .ragu to isDelicious(_:)

```

By adopting [`CustomTestStringConvertible`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customteststringconvertible), customized descriptions can be included:

```
extension Food: CustomTestStringConvertible {
  var testDescription: String {
    switch self {
    case .paella:
      "paella valenciana"
    case .oden:
      "おでん"
    case .ragu:
      "ragù alla bolognese"
    }
  }
}

```

The presentation of these values will then reflect the value of the [`testDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customteststringconvertible/testdescription) property:

```
◇ Passing argument food → paella valenciana to isDelicious(_:)
◇ Passing argument food → おでん to isDelicious(_:)
◇ Passing argument food → ragù alla bolognese to isDelicious(_:)

```

## Migrating from XCTest

# Migrating a test from XCTest

Migrate an existing test method or test class written using XCTest.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Overview)

The testing library provides much of the same functionality of XCTest, but uses its own syntax to declare test functions and types. Here, you’ll learn how to convert XCTest-based content to use the testing library instead.

### [Import the testing library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Import-the-testing-library)

XCTest and the testing library are available from different modules. Instead of importing the XCTest module, import the Testing module:

```
// Before
import XCTest

```

```
// After
import Testing

```

A single source file can contain tests written with XCTest as well as other tests written with the testing library. Import both XCTest and Testing if a source file contains mixed test content.

### [Convert test classes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Convert-test-classes)

XCTest groups related sets of test methods in test classes: classes that inherit from the [`XCTestCase`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestcase) class provided by the [XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest) framework. The testing library doesn’t require that test functions be instance members of types. Instead, they can be _free_ or _global_ functions, or can be `static` or `class` members of a type.

If you want to group your test functions together, you can do so by placing them in a Swift type. The testing library refers to such a type as a _suite_. These types do _not_ need to be classes, and they don’t inherit from `XCTestCase`.

To convert a subclass of `XCTestCase` to a suite, remove the `XCTestCase` conformance. It’s also generally recommended that a Swift structure or actor be used instead of a class because it allows the Swift compiler to better-enforce concurrency safety:

```
// Before
class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
  ...
}

```

```
// After
struct FoodTruckTests {
  ...
}

```

For more information about suites and how to declare and customize them, see [Organizing test functions with suite types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests).

### [Convert setup and teardown functions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Convert-setup-and-teardown-functions)

In XCTest, code can be scheduled to run before and after a test using the [`setUp()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctest/3856481-setup) and [`tearDown()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctest/3856482-teardown) family of functions. When writing tests using the testing library, implement `init()` and/or `deinit` instead:

```
// Before
class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
  var batteryLevel: NSNumber!
  override func setUp() async throws {
    batteryLevel = 100
  }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
struct FoodTruckTests {
  var batteryLevel: NSNumber
  init() async throws {
    batteryLevel = 100
  }
  ...
}

```

The use of `async` and `throws` is optional. If teardown is needed, declare your test suite as a class or as an actor rather than as a structure and implement `deinit`:

```
// Before
class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
  var batteryLevel: NSNumber!
  override func setUp() async throws {
    batteryLevel = 100
  }
  override func tearDown() {
    batteryLevel = 0 // drain the battery
  }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
final class FoodTruckTests {
  var batteryLevel: NSNumber
  init() async throws {
    batteryLevel = 100
  }
  deinit {
    batteryLevel = 0 // drain the battery
  }
  ...
}

```

### [Convert test methods](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Convert-test-methods)

The testing library represents individual tests as functions, similar to how they are represented in XCTest. However, the syntax for declaring a test function is different. In XCTest, a test method must be a member of a test class and its name must start with `test`. The testing library doesn’t require a test function to have any particular name. Instead, it identifies a test function by the presence of the `@Test` attribute:

```
// Before
class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
  func testEngineWorks() { ... }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
struct FoodTruckTests {
  @Test func engineWorks() { ... }
  ...
}

```

As with XCTest, the testing library allows test functions to be marked `async`, `throws`, or `async`- `throws`, and to be isolated to a global actor (for example, by using the `@MainActor` attribute.)

For more information about test functions and how to declare and customize them, see [Defining test functions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/definingtests).

### [Check for expected values and outcomes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Check-for-expected-values-and-outcomes)

XCTest uses a family of approximately 40 functions to assert test requirements. These functions are collectively referred to as [`XCTAssert()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/1500669-xctassert). The testing library has two replacements, [`expect(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expect(_:_:sourcelocation:)) and [`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q). They both behave similarly to `XCTAssert()` except that [`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q) throws an error if its condition isn’t met:

```
// Before
func testEngineWorks() throws {
  let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
  XCTAssertNotNil(engine.parts.first)
  XCTAssertGreaterThan(engine.batteryLevel, 0)
  try engine.start()
  XCTAssertTrue(engine.isRunning)
}

```

```
// After
@Test func engineWorks() throws {
  let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
  try #require(engine.parts.first != nil)
  #expect(engine.batteryLevel > 0)
  try engine.start()
  #expect(engine.isRunning)
}

```

### [Check for optional values](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Check-for-optional-values)

XCTest also has a function, [`XCTUnwrap()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3380195-xctunwrap), that tests if an optional value is `nil` and throws an error if it is. When using the testing library, you can use [`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-6w9oo) with optional expressions to unwrap them:

```
// Before
func testEngineWorks() throws {
  let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
  let part = try XCTUnwrap(engine.parts.first)
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func engineWorks() throws {
  let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
  let part = try #require(engine.parts.first)
  ...
}

```

### [Record issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Record-issues)

XCTest has a function, [`XCTFail()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/1500970-xctfail), that causes a test to fail immediately and unconditionally. This function is useful when the syntax of the language prevents the use of an `XCTAssert()` function. To record an unconditional issue using the testing library, use the [`record(_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/issue/record(_:sourcelocation:)) function:

```
// Before
func testEngineWorks() {
  let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
  guard case .electric = engine else {
    XCTFail("Engine is not electric")
    return
  }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func engineWorks() {
  let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
  guard case .electric = engine else {
    Issue.record("Engine is not electric")
    return
  }
  ...
}

```

The following table includes a list of the various `XCTAssert()` functions and their equivalents in the testing library:

| XCTest | Swift Testing |
| --- | --- |
| `XCTAssert(x)`, `XCTAssertTrue(x)` | `#expect(x)` |
| `XCTAssertFalse(x)` | `#expect(!x)` |
| `XCTAssertNil(x)` | `#expect(x == nil)` |
| `XCTAssertNotNil(x)` | `#expect(x != nil)` |
| `XCTAssertEqual(x, y)` | `#expect(x == y)` |
| `XCTAssertNotEqual(x, y)` | `#expect(x != y)` |
| `XCTAssertIdentical(x, y)` | `#expect(x === y)` |
| `XCTAssertNotIdentical(x, y)` | `#expect(x !== y)` |
| `XCTAssertGreaterThan(x, y)` | `#expect(x > y)` |
| `XCTAssertGreaterThanOrEqual(x, y)` | `#expect(x >= y)` |
| `XCTAssertLessThanOrEqual(x, y)` | `#expect(x <= y)` |
| `XCTAssertLessThan(x, y)` | `#expect(x < y)` |
| `XCTAssertThrowsError(try f())` | `#expect(throws: (any Error).self) { try f() }` |
| `XCTAssertThrowsError(try f()) { error in … }` | `let error = #expect(throws: (any Error).self) { try f() }` |
| `XCTAssertNoThrow(try f())` | `#expect(throws: Never.self) { try f() }` |
| `try XCTUnwrap(x)` | `try #require(x)` |
| `XCTFail("…")` | `Issue.record("…")` |

The testing library doesn’t provide an equivalent of [`XCTAssertEqual(_:_:accuracy:_:file:line:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3551607-xctassertequal). To compare two numeric values within a specified accuracy, use `isApproximatelyEqual()` from [swift-numerics](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics).

### [Continue or halt after test failures](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Continue-or-halt-after-test-failures)

An instance of an `XCTestCase` subclass can set its [`continueAfterFailure`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestcase/1496260-continueafterfailure) property to `false` to cause a test to stop running after a failure occurs. XCTest stops an affected test by throwing an Objective-C exception at the time the failure occurs.

The behavior of an exception thrown through a Swift stack frame is undefined. If an exception is thrown through an `async` Swift function, it typically causes the process to terminate abnormally, preventing other tests from running.

The testing library doesn’t use exceptions to stop test functions. Instead, use the [`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q) macro, which throws a Swift error on failure:

```
// Before
func testTruck() async {
  continueAfterFailure = false
  XCTAssertTrue(FoodTruck.shared.isLicensed)
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func truck() throws {
  try #require(FoodTruck.shared.isLicensed)
  ...
}

```

When using either `continueAfterFailure` or [`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q), other tests will continue to run after the failed test method or test function.

### [Validate asynchronous behaviors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Validate-asynchronous-behaviors)

XCTest has a class, [`XCTestExpectation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestexpectation), that represents some asynchronous condition. You create an instance of this class (or a subclass like [`XCTKeyPathExpectation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctkeypathexpectation)) using an initializer or a convenience method on `XCTestCase`. When the condition represented by an expectation occurs, the developer _fulfills_ the expectation. Concurrently, the developer _waits for_ the expectation to be fulfilled using an instance of [`XCTWaiter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctwaiter) or using a convenience method on `XCTestCase`.

Wherever possible, prefer to use Swift concurrency to validate asynchronous conditions. For example, if it’s necessary to determine the result of an asynchronous Swift function, it can be awaited with `await`. For a function that takes a completion handler but which doesn’t use `await`, a Swift [continuation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/withcheckedcontinuation(function:_:)) can be used to convert the call into an `async`-compatible one.

Some tests, especially those that test asynchronously-delivered events, cannot be readily converted to use Swift concurrency. The testing library offers functionality called _confirmations_ which can be used to implement these tests. Instances of [`Confirmation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation) are created and used within the scope of the functions [`confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-5mqz2) and [`confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-l3il).

Confirmations function similarly to the expectations API of XCTest, however, they don’t block or suspend the caller while waiting for a condition to be fulfilled. Instead, the requirement is expected to be _confirmed_ (the equivalent of _fulfilling_ an expectation) before `confirmation()` returns, and records an issue otherwise:

```
// Before
func testTruckEvents() async {
  let soldFood = expectation(description: "…")
  FoodTruck.shared.eventHandler = { event in
    if case .soldFood = event {
      soldFood.fulfill()
    }
  }
  await Customer().buy(.soup)
  await fulfillment(of: [soldFood])
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func truckEvents() async {
  await confirmation("…") { soldFood in
    FoodTruck.shared.eventHandler = { event in
      if case .soldFood = event {
        soldFood()
      }
    }
    await Customer().buy(.soup)
  }
  ...
}

```

By default, `XCTestExpectation` expects to be fulfilled exactly once, and will record an issue in the current test if it is not fulfilled or if it is fulfilled more than once. `Confirmation` behaves the same way and expects to be confirmed exactly once by default. You can configure the number of times an expectation should be fulfilled by setting its [`expectedFulfillmentCount`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestexpectation/2806572-expectedfulfillmentcount) property, and you can pass a value for the `expectedCount` argument of [`confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-5mqz2) for the same purpose.

`XCTestExpectation` has a property, [`assertForOverFulfill`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestexpectation/2806575-assertforoverfulfill), which when set to `false` allows an expectation to be fulfilled more times than expected without causing a test failure. When using a confirmation, you can pass a range to [`confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-l3il) as its expected count to indicate that it must be confirmed _at least_ some number of times:

```
// Before
func testRegularCustomerOrders() async {
  let soldFood = expectation(description: "…")
  soldFood.expectedFulfillmentCount = 10
  soldFood.assertForOverFulfill = false
  FoodTruck.shared.eventHandler = { event in
    if case .soldFood = event {
      soldFood.fulfill()
    }
  }
  for customer in regularCustomers() {
    await customer.buy(customer.regularOrder)
  }
  await fulfillment(of: [soldFood])
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func regularCustomerOrders() async {
  await confirmation(
    "…",
    expectedCount: 10...
  ) { soldFood in
    FoodTruck.shared.eventHandler = { event in
      if case .soldFood = event {
        soldFood()
      }
    }
    for customer in regularCustomers() {
      await customer.buy(customer.regularOrder)
    }
  }
  ...
}

```

Any range expression with a lower bound (that is, whose type conforms to both [`RangeExpression<Int>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rangeexpression) and [`Sequence<Int>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence)) can be used with [`confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-l3il). You must specify a lower bound for the number of confirmations because, without one, the testing library cannot tell if an issue should be recorded when there have been zero confirmations.

### [Control whether a test runs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Control-whether-a-test-runs)

When using XCTest, the [`XCTSkip`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctskip) error type can be thrown to bypass the remainder of a test function. As well, the [`XCTSkipIf()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3521325-xctskipif) and [`XCTSkipUnless()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3521326-xctskipunless) functions can be used to conditionalize the same action. The testing library allows developers to skip a test function or an entire test suite before it starts running using the [`ConditionTrait`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/conditiontrait) trait type. Annotate a test suite or test function with an instance of this trait type to control whether it runs:

```
// Before
class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
  func testArepasAreTasty() throws {
    try XCTSkipIf(CashRegister.isEmpty)
    try XCTSkipUnless(FoodTruck.sells(.arepas))
    ...
  }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Suite(.disabled(if: CashRegister.isEmpty))
struct FoodTruckTests {
  @Test(.enabled(if: FoodTruck.sells(.arepas)))
  func arepasAreTasty() {
    ...
  }
  ...
}

```

### [Annotate known issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Annotate-known-issues)

A test may have a known issue that sometimes or always prevents it from passing. When written using XCTest, such tests can call [`XCTExpectFailure(_:options:failingBlock:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3727246-xctexpectfailure) to tell XCTest and its infrastructure that the issue shouldn’t cause the test to fail. The testing library has an equivalent function with synchronous and asynchronous variants:

- [`withKnownIssue(_:isIntermittent:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:sourcelocation:_:))

- [`withKnownIssue(_:isIntermittent:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:isolation:sourcelocation:_:))


This function can be used to annotate a section of a test as having a known issue:

```
// Before
func testGrillWorks() async {
  XCTExpectFailure("Grill is out of fuel") {
    try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
  }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func grillWorks() async {
  withKnownIssue("Grill is out of fuel") {
    try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
  }
  ...
}

```

If a test may fail intermittently, the call to `XCTExpectFailure(_:options:failingBlock:)` can be marked _non-strict_. When using the testing library, specify that the known issue is _intermittent_ instead:

```
// Before
func testGrillWorks() async {
  XCTExpectFailure(
    "Grill may need fuel",
    options: .nonStrict()
  ) {
    try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
  }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func grillWorks() async {
  withKnownIssue(
    "Grill may need fuel",
    isIntermittent: true
  ) {
    try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
  }
  ...
}

```

Additional options can be specified when calling `XCTExpectFailure()`:

- [`isEnabled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctexpectedfailure/options/3726085-isenabled) can be set to `false` to skip known-issue matching (for instance, if a particular issue only occurs under certain conditions)

- [`issueMatcher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctexpectedfailure/options/3726086-issuematcher) can be set to a closure to allow marking only certain issues as known and to allow other issues to be recorded as test failures


The testing library includes overloads of `withKnownIssue()` that take additional arguments with similar behavior:

- [`withKnownIssue(_:isIntermittent:sourceLocation:_:when:matching:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:sourcelocation:_:when:matching:))

- [`withKnownIssue(_:isIntermittent:isolation:sourceLocation:_:when:matching:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:isolation:sourcelocation:_:when:matching:))


To conditionally enable known-issue matching or to match only certain kinds of issues:

```
// Before
func testGrillWorks() async {
  let options = XCTExpectedFailure.Options()
  options.isEnabled = FoodTruck.shared.hasGrill
  options.issueMatcher = { issue in
    issue.type == thrownError
  }
  XCTExpectFailure(
    "Grill is out of fuel",
    options: options
  ) {
    try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
  }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func grillWorks() async {
  withKnownIssue("Grill is out of fuel") {
    try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
  } when: {
    FoodTruck.shared.hasGrill
  } matching: { issue in
    issue.error != nil
  }
  ...
}

```

### [Run tests sequentially](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Run-tests-sequentially)

By default, the testing library runs all tests in a suite in parallel. The default behavior of XCTest is to run each test in a suite sequentially. If your tests use shared state such as global variables, you may see unexpected behavior including unreliable test outcomes when you run tests in parallel.

Annotate your test suite with [`serialized`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/serialized) to run tests within that suite serially:

```
// Before
class RefrigeratorTests : XCTestCase {
  func testLightComesOn() throws {
    try FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.openDoor()
    XCTAssertEqual(FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.lightState, .on)
  }

  func testLightGoesOut() throws {
    try FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.openDoor()
    try FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.closeDoor()
    XCTAssertEqual(FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.lightState, .off)
  }
}

```

```
// After
@Suite(.serialized)
class RefrigeratorTests {
  @Test func lightComesOn() throws {
    try FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.openDoor()
    #expect(FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.lightState == .on)
  }

  @Test func lightGoesOut() throws {
    try FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.openDoor()
    try FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.closeDoor()
    #expect(FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.lightState == .off)
  }
}

```

Structure

# ParallelizationTrait

A type that defines whether the testing library runs this test serially or in parallel.

```
struct ParallelizationTrait
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelizationtrait\#overview)

When you add this trait to a parameterized test function, that test runs its cases serially instead of in parallel. This trait has no effect when you apply it to a non-parameterized test function.

When you add this trait to a test suite, that suite runs its contained test functions (including their cases, when parameterized) and sub-suites serially instead of in parallel. If the sub-suites have children, they also run serially.

This trait does not affect the execution of a test relative to its peers or to unrelated tests. This trait has no effect if you disable test parallelization globally (for example, by passing `--no-parallel` to the `swift test` command.)

To add this trait to a test, use [`serialized`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/serialized).

# Running tests serially or in parallel

Control whether tests run serially or in parallel.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelization\#Overview)

By default, tests run in parallel with respect to each other. Parallelization is accomplished by the testing library using task groups, and tests generally all run in the same process. The number of tests that run concurrently is controlled by the Swift runtime.

## [Disabling parallelization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelization\#Disabling-parallelization)

Parallelization can be disabled on a per-function or per-suite basis using the [`serialized`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/serialized) trait:

```
@Test(.serialized, arguments: Food.allCases) func prepare(food: Food) {
  // This function will be invoked serially, once per food, because it has the
  // .serialized trait.
}

@Suite(.serialized) struct FoodTruckTests {
  @Test(arguments: Condiment.allCases) func refill(condiment: Condiment) {
    // This function will be invoked serially, once per condiment, because the
    // containing suite has the .serialized trait.
  }

  @Test func startEngine() async throws {
    // This function will not run while refill(condiment:) is running. One test
    // must end before the other will start.
  }
}

```

When added to a parameterized test function, this trait causes that test to run its cases serially instead of in parallel. When applied to a non-parameterized test function, this trait has no effect. When applied to a test suite, this trait causes that suite to run its contained test functions and sub-suites serially instead of in parallel.

This trait is recursively applied: if it is applied to a suite, any parameterized tests or test suites contained in that suite are also serialized (as are any tests contained in those suites, and so on.)

This trait doesn’t affect the execution of a test relative to its peers or to unrelated tests. This trait has no effect if test parallelization is globally disabled (by, for example, passing `--no-parallel` to the `swift test` command.)

# Enabling and disabling tests

Conditionally enable or disable individual tests before they run.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/enablinganddisabling\#Overview)

Often, a test is only applicable in specific circumstances. For instance, you might want to write a test that only runs on devices with particular hardware capabilities, or performs locale-dependent operations. The testing library allows you to add traits to your tests that cause runners to automatically skip them if conditions like these are not met.

### [Disable a test](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/enablinganddisabling\#Disable-a-test)

If you need to disable a test unconditionally, use the [`disabled(_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/disabled(_:sourcelocation:)) function. Given the following test function:

```
@Test("Food truck sells burritos")
func sellsBurritos() async throws { ... }

```

Add the trait _after_ the test’s display name:

```
@Test("Food truck sells burritos", .disabled())
func sellsBurritos() async throws { ... }

```

The test will now always be skipped.

It’s also possible to add a comment to the trait to present in the output from the runner when it skips the test:

```
@Test("Food truck sells burritos", .disabled("We only sell Thai cuisine"))
func sellsBurritos() async throws { ... }

```

### [Enable or disable a test conditionally](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/enablinganddisabling\#Enable-or-disable-a-test-conditionally)

Sometimes, it makes sense to enable a test only when a certain condition is met. Consider the following test function:

```
@Test("Ice cream is cold")
func isCold() async throws { ... }

```

If it’s currently winter, then presumably ice cream won’t be available for sale and this test will fail. It therefore makes sense to only enable it if it’s currently summer. You can conditionally enable a test with [`enabled(if:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/enabled(if:_:sourcelocation:)):

```
@Test("Ice cream is cold", .enabled(if: Season.current == .summer))
func isCold() async throws { ... }

```

It’s also possible to conditionally _disable_ a test and to combine multiple conditions:

```
@Test(
  "Ice cream is cold",
  .enabled(if: Season.current == .summer),
  .disabled("We ran out of sprinkles")
)
func isCold() async throws { ... }

```

If a test is disabled because of a problem for which there is a corresponding bug report, you can use one of these functions to show the relationship between the test and the bug report:

- [`bug(_:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:_:))

- [`bug(_:id:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:id:_:)-10yf5)

- [`bug(_:id:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:id:_:)-3vtpl)


For example, the following test cannot run due to bug number `"12345"`:

```
@Test(
  "Ice cream is cold",
  .enabled(if: Season.current == .summer),
  .disabled("We ran out of sprinkles"),
  .bug(id: "12345")
)
func isCold() async throws { ... }

```

If a test has multiple conditions applied to it, they must _all_ pass for it to run. Otherwise, the test notes the first condition to fail as the reason the test is skipped.

### [Handle complex conditions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/enablinganddisabling\#Handle-complex-conditions)

If a condition is complex, consider factoring it out into a helper function to improve readability:

```
func allIngredientsAvailable(for food: Food) -> Bool { ... }

@Test(
  "Can make sundaes",
  .enabled(if: Season.current == .summer),
  .enabled(if: allIngredientsAvailable(for: .sundae))
)
func makeSundae() async throws { ... }

```

### [Customizing runtime behaviors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/enablinganddisabling\#Customizing-runtime-behaviors)

[Limiting the running time of tests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/limitingexecutiontime)

[`static func enabled(Comment?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation, () async throws -> Bool) -> Self`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/enabled(_:sourcelocation:_:))

Constructs a condition trait that disables a test if it returns `false`.

[`static func disabled(Comment?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation) -> Self`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/disabled(_:sourcelocation:))

Constructs a condition trait that disables a test unconditionally.

[`static func disabled(if: @autoclosure () throws -> Bool, Comment?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation) -> Self`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/disabled(if:_:sourcelocation:))

Constructs a condition trait that disables a test if its value is true.

[`static func disabled(Comment?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation, () async throws -> Bool) -> Self`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/disabled(_:sourcelocation:_:))

Constructs a condition trait that disables a test if its value is true.

[`static func timeLimit(TimeLimitTrait.Duration) -> Self`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/timelimit(_:))

Construct a time limit trait that causes a test to time out if it runs for too long.

API Collection

# Expectations and confirmations

Check for expected values, outcomes, and asynchronous events in tests.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expectations\#Overview)

Use [`expect(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expect(_:_:sourcelocation:)) and [`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q) macros to validate expected outcomes. To validate that an error is thrown, or _not_ thrown, the testing library provides several overloads of the macros that you can use. For more information, see [Testing for errors in Swift code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-for-errors-in-swift-code).

Use a [`Confirmation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation) to confirm the occurrence of an asynchronous event that you can’t check directly using an expectation. For more information, see [Testing asynchronous code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-asynchronous-code).

### [Validate your code’s result](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expectations\#Validate-your-codes-result)

To validate that your code produces an expected value, use [`expect(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expect(_:_:sourcelocation:)). This macro captures the expression you pass, and provides detailed information when the code doesn’t satisfy the expectation.

```
@Test func calculatingOrderTotal() {
  let calculator = OrderCalculator()
  #expect(calculator.total(of: [3, 3]) == 7)
  // Prints "Expectation failed: (calculator.total(of: [3, 3]) → 6) == 7"
}

```

Your test keeps running after [`expect(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expect(_:_:sourcelocation:)) fails. To stop the test when the code doesn’t satisfy a requirement, use [`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q) instead:

```
@Test func returningCustomerRemembersUsualOrder() throws {
  let customer = try #require(Customer(id: 123))
  // The test runner doesn't reach this line if the customer is nil.
  #expect(customer.usualOrder.countOfItems == 2)
}

```

[`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q) throws an instance of [`ExpectationFailedError`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expectationfailederror) when your code fails to satisfy the requirement.

## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expectations\#topics)

### [Checking expectations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expectations\#Checking-expectations)

[`macro expect(Bool, @autoclosure () -> Comment?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expect(_:_:sourcelocation:))

[`macro require(Bool, @autoclosure () -> Comment?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q)

Check that an expectation has passed after a condition has been evaluated and throw an error if it failed.

[`macro require<T>(T?, @autoclosure () -> Comment?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation) -> T`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-6w9oo)

Unwrap an optional value or, if it is `nil`, fail and throw an error.

### [Checking that errors are thrown](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expectations\#Checking-that-errors-are-thrown)

[Testing for errors in Swift code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-for-errors-in-swift-code)

# Associating bugs with tests

Associate bugs uncovered or verified by tests.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/associatingbugs\#Overview)

Tests allow developers to prove that the code they write is working as expected. If code isn’t working correctly, bug trackers are often used to track the work necessary to fix the underlying problem. It’s often useful to associate specific bugs with tests that reproduce them or verify they are fixed.

## [Associate a bug with a test](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/associatingbugs\#Associate-a-bug-with-a-test)

To associate a bug with a test, use one of these functions:

- [`bug(_:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:_:))

- [`bug(_:id:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:id:_:)-10yf5)

- [`bug(_:id:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:id:_:)-3vtpl)


The first argument to these functions is a URL representing the bug in its bug-tracking system:

```
@Test("Food truck engine works", .bug("https://www.example.com/issues/12345"))
func engineWorks() async {
  var foodTruck = FoodTruck()
  await foodTruck.engine.start()
  #expect(foodTruck.engine.isRunning)
}

```

You can also specify the bug’s _unique identifier_ in its bug-tracking system in addition to, or instead of, its URL:

```
@Test(
  "Food truck engine works",
  .bug(id: "12345"),
  .bug("https://www.example.com/issues/67890", id: 67890)
)
func engineWorks() async {
  var foodTruck = FoodTruck()
  await foodTruck.engine.start()
  #expect(foodTruck.engine.isRunning)
}

```

A bug’s URL is passed as a string and must be parseable according to [RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt). A bug’s unique identifier can be passed as an integer or as a string. For more information on the formats recognized by the testing library, see [Interpreting bug identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/bugidentifiers).

## [Add titles to associated bugs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/associatingbugs\#Add-titles-to-associated-bugs)

A bug’s unique identifier or URL may be insufficient to uniquely and clearly identify a bug associated with a test. Bug trackers universally provide a “title” field for bugs that is not visible to the testing library. To add a bug’s title to a test, include it after the bug’s unique identifier or URL:

```
@Test(
  "Food truck has napkins",
  .bug(id: "12345", "Forgot to buy more napkins")
)
func hasNapkins() async {
  ...
}

```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/timelimittrait/duration\#overview)

Use this type to specify a test timeout with [`TimeLimitTrait`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/timelimittrait). `TimeLimitTrait` uses this type instead of Swift’s built-in `Duration` type because the testing library doesn’t support high-precision, arbitrarily short durations for test timeouts. The smallest unit of time you can specify in a `Duration` is minutes.

# Testing asynchronous code

Validate whether your code causes expected events to happen.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-asynchronous-code\#Overview)

The testing library integrates with Swift concurrency, meaning that in many situations you can test asynchronous code using standard Swift features. Mark your test function as `async` and, in the function body, `await` any asynchronous interactions:

```
@Test func priceLookupYieldsExpectedValue() async {
  let mozarellaPrice = await unitPrice(for: .mozarella)
  #expect(mozarellaPrice == 3)
}

```

In more complex situations you can use [`Confirmation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation) to discover whether an expected event happens.

### [Confirm that an event happens](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-asynchronous-code\#Confirm-that-an-event-happens)

Call [`confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-5mqz2) in your asynchronous test function to create a `Confirmation` for the expected event. In the trailing closure parameter, call the code under test. Swift Testing passes a `Confirmation` as the parameter to the closure, which you call as a function in the event handler for the code under test when the event you’re testing for occurs:

```
@Test("OrderCalculator successfully calculates subtotal for no pizzas")
func subtotalForNoPizzas() async {
  let calculator = OrderCalculator()
  await confirmation() { confirmation in
    calculator.successHandler = { _ in confirmation() }
    _ = await calculator.subtotal(for: PizzaToppings(bases: []))
  }
}

```

If you expect the event to happen more than once, set the `expectedCount` parameter to the number of expected occurrences. The test passes if the number of occurrences during the test matches the expected count, and fails otherwise.

You can also pass a range to [`confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-l3il) if the exact number of times the event occurs may change over time or is random:

```
@Test("Customers bought sandwiches")
func boughtSandwiches() async {
  await confirmation(expectedCount: 0 ..< 1000) { boughtSandwich in
    var foodTruck = FoodTruck()
    foodTruck.orderHandler = { order in
      if order.contains(.sandwich) {
        boughtSandwich()
      }
    }
    await FoodTruck.operate()
  }
}

```

In this example, there may be zero customers or up to (but not including) 1,000 customers who order sandwiches. Any [range expression](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rangeexpression) which includes an explicit lower bound can be used:

| Range Expression | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `1...` | If an event must occur _at least_ once |
| `5...` | If an event must occur _at least_ five times |
| `1 ... 5` | If an event must occur at least once, but not more than five times |
| `0 ..< 100` | If an event may or may not occur, but _must not_ occur more than 99 times |

### [Confirm that an event doesn’t happen](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-asynchronous-code\#Confirm-that-an-event-doesnt-happen)

To validate that a particular event doesn’t occur during a test, create a `Confirmation` with an expected count of `0`:

```
@Test func orderCalculatorEncountersNoErrors() async {
  let calculator = OrderCalculator()
  await confirmation(expectedCount: 0) { confirmation in
    calculator.errorHandler = { _ in confirmation() }
    calculator.subtotal(for: PizzaToppings(bases: []))
  }
}

```

### [Confirming that asynchronous events occur](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-asynchronous-code\#Confirming-that-asynchronous-events-occur)

[`func confirmation<R>(Comment?, expectedCount: Int, isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation, (Confirmation) async throws -> sending R) async rethrows -> R`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-5mqz2)

Confirm that some event occurs during the invocation of a function.

[`func confirmation<R>(Comment?, expectedCount: some RangeExpression<Int> & Sendable & Sequence<Int>, isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation, (Confirmation) async throws -> sending R) async rethrows -> R`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-l3il)

Confirm that some event occurs during the invocation of a function.

[`struct Confirmation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation)

A type that can be used to confirm that an event occurs zero or more times.

# ParallelizationTrait

A type that defines whether the testing library runs this test serially or in parallel.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalystmacOStvOSvisionOSwatchOSSwift 6.0+Xcode 16.0+

```
struct ParallelizationTrait
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelizationtrait?changes=__2\#overview)

When you add this trait to a parameterized test function, that test runs its cases serially instead of in parallel. This trait has no effect when you apply it to a non-parameterized test function.

When you add this trait to a test suite, that suite runs its contained test functions (including their cases, when parameterized) and sub-suites serially instead of in parallel. If the sub-suites have children, they also run serially.

This trait does not affect the execution of a test relative to its peers or to unrelated tests. This trait has no effect if you disable test parallelization globally (for example, by passing `--no-parallel` to the `swift test` command.)

To add this trait to a test, use [`serialized`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/serialized?changes=__2).

Type Method

# timeLimit(\_:)

Construct a time limit trait that causes a test to time out if it runs for too long.

iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+tvOS 16.0+visionOSwatchOS 9.0+Swift 6.0+Xcode 16.0+

```
static func timeLimit(_ timeLimit: TimeLimitTrait.Duration) -> Self
```

Available when `Self` is `TimeLimitTrait`.

## [Parameters](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/timelimit(_:)\#parameters)

`timeLimit`

The maximum amount of time the test may run for.

## [Return Value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/timelimit(_:)\#return-value)

An instance of [`TimeLimitTrait`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/timelimittrait).

## [Mentioned in](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/timelimit(_:)\#mentions)

[Limiting the running time of tests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/limitingexecutiontime)

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/timelimit(_:)\#discussion)

Test timeouts do not support high-precision, arbitrarily short durations due to variability in testing environments. You express the duration in minutes, with a minimum duration of one minute.

When you associate this trait with a test, that test must complete within a time limit of, at most, `timeLimit`. If the test runs longer, the testing library records a [`Issue.Kind.timeLimitExceeded(timeLimitComponents:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/issue/kind-swift.enum/timelimitexceeded(timelimitcomponents:)) issue, which it treats as a test failure.

The testing library can use a shorter time limit than that specified by `timeLimit` if you configure it to enforce a maximum per-test limit. When you configure a maximum per-test limit, the time limit of the test this trait is applied to is the shorter of `timeLimit` and the maximum per-test limit. For information on configuring maximum per-test limits, consult the documentation for the tool you use to run your tests.

If a test is parameterized, this time limit is applied to each of its test cases individually. If a test has more than one time limit associated with it, the testing library uses the shortest time limit.

Instance Method

# scopeProvider(for:testCase:)

Swift 6.1+Xcode 16.3+

```
func scopeProvider(
    for test: Test,
    testCase: Test.Case?
) -> Self.TestScopeProvider?
```

**Required** Default implementations provided.

## [Parameters](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/scopeprovider(for:testcase:)\#parameters)

`test`

The test for which a scope provider is being requested.

`testCase`

The test case for which a scope provider is being requested, if any. When `test` represents a suite, the value of this argument is `nil`.

## [Return Value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/scopeprovider(for:testcase:)\#return-value)

A value conforming to [`TestScopeProvider`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/testscopeprovider) which you use to provide custom scoping for `test` or `testCase`. Returns `nil` if the trait doesn’t provide any custom scope for the test or test case.

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/scopeprovider(for:testcase:)\#discussion)

If this trait’s type conforms to [`TestScoping`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testscoping), the default value returned by this method depends on the values of `test` and `testCase`:

- If `test` represents a suite, this trait must conform to [`SuiteTrait`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/suitetrait). If the value of this suite trait’s [`isRecursive`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/suitetrait/isrecursive) property is `true`, then this method returns `nil`, and the suite trait provides its custom scope once for each test function the test suite contains. If the value of [`isRecursive`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/suitetrait/isrecursive) is `false`, this method returns `self`, and the suite trait provides its custom scope once for the entire test suite.

- If `test` represents a test function, this trait also conforms to [`TestTrait`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testtrait). If `testCase` is `nil`, this method returns `nil`; otherwise, it returns `self`. This means that by default, a trait which is applied to or inherited by a test function provides its custom scope once for each of that function’s cases.


A trait may override this method to further customize the default behaviors above. For example, if a trait needs to provide custom test scope both once per-suite and once per-test function in that suite, it implements the method to return a non- `nil` scope provider under those conditions.

A trait may also implement this method and return `nil` if it determines that it does not need to provide a custom scope for a particular test at runtime, even if the test has the trait applied. This can improve performance and make diagnostics clearer by avoiding an unnecessary call to [`provideScope(for:testCase:performing:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testscoping/providescope(for:testcase:performing:)).

If this trait’s type does not conform to [`TestScoping`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testscoping) and its associated [`TestScopeProvider`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/testscopeprovider) type is the default `Never`, then this method returns `nil` by default. This means that instances of this trait don’t provide a custom scope for tests to which they’re applied.

## Test Execution Control

- [Traits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/traits?changes=_3)
- Running tests serially or in parallel

Article

# Running tests serially or in parallel

Control whether tests run serially or in parallel.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelization?changes=_3\#Overview)

By default, tests run in parallel with respect to each other. Parallelization is accomplished by the testing library using task groups, and tests generally all run in the same process. The number of tests that run concurrently is controlled by the Swift runtime.

## [Disabling parallelization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelization?changes=_3\#Disabling-parallelization)

Parallelization can be disabled on a per-function or per-suite basis using the [`serialized`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/serialized?changes=_3) trait:

```
@Test(.serialized, arguments: Food.allCases) func prepare(food: Food) {
  // This function will be invoked serially, once per food, because it has the
  // .serialized trait.
}

@Suite(.serialized) struct FoodTruckTests {
  @Test(arguments: Condiment.allCases) func refill(condiment: Condiment) {
    // This function will be invoked serially, once per condiment, because the
    // containing suite has the .serialized trait.
  }

  @Test func startEngine() async throws {
    // This function will not run while refill(condiment:) is running. One test
    // must end before the other will start.
  }
}

```

When added to a parameterized test function, this trait causes that test to run its cases serially instead of in parallel. When applied to a non-parameterized test function, this trait has no effect. When applied to a test suite, this trait causes that suite to run its contained test functions and sub-suites serially instead of in parallel.

This trait is recursively applied: if it is applied to a suite, any parameterized tests or test suites contained in that suite are also serialized (as are any tests contained in those suites, and so on.)

This trait doesn’t affect the execution of a test relative to its peers or to unrelated tests. This trait has no effect if test parallelization is globally disabled (by, for example, passing `--no-parallel` to the `swift test` command.)

```

## [Parameters](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:sourcelocation:_:)\#parameters)

`comment`

An optional comment to apply to any issues generated by this function.

`expectedCount`

The number of times the expected event should occur when `body` is invoked. The default value of this argument is `1`, indicating that the event should occur exactly once. Pass `0` if the event should _never_ occur when `body` is invoked.

[Testing asynchronous code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-asynchronous-code)

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:sourcelocation:_:)\#discussion)

Use confirmations to check that an event occurs while a test is running in complex scenarios where `#expect()` and `#require()` are insufficient. For example, a confirmation may be useful when an expected event occurs:

- In a context that cannot be awaited by the calling function such as an event handler or delegate callback;

- More than once, or never; or

- As a callback that is invoked as part of a larger operation.


To use a confirmation, pass a closure containing the work to be performed. The testing library will then pass an instance of [`Confirmation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation) to the closure. Every time the event in question occurs, the closure should call the confirmation:

```
let n = 10
await confirmation("Baked buns", expectedCount: n) { bunBaked in
  foodTruck.eventHandler = { event in
    if event == .baked(.cinnamonBun) {
      bunBaked()
    }
  }
  await foodTruck.bake(.cinnamonBun, count: n)
}

```

When the closure returns, the testing library checks if the confirmation’s preconditions have been met, and records an issue if they have not.

- [Swift Testing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing)
- withKnownIssue(\_:isIntermittent:sourceLocation:\_:when:matching:)

Function

# withKnownIssue(\_:isIntermittent:sourceLocation:\_:when:matching:)

Invoke a function that has a known issue that is expected to occur during its execution.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalystmacOStvOSvisionOSwatchOSSwift 6.0+Xcode 16.0+

```
func withKnownIssue(
    _ comment: Comment? = nil,

    sourceLocation: SourceLocation = #_sourceLocation,
    _ body: () throws -> Void,
    when precondition: () -> Bool = { true },
    matching issueMatcher: @escaping KnownIssueMatcher = { _ in true }
) rethrows
```

## [Parameters](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:sourcelocation:_:when:matching:)\#parameters)

`comment`

An optional comment describing the known issue.

`isIntermittent`

Whether or not the known issue occurs intermittently. If this argument is `true` and the known issue does not occur, no secondary issue is recorded.

`sourceLocation`

The source location to which any recorded issues should be attributed.

`body`

The function to invoke.

`precondition`

A function that determines if issues are known to occur during the execution of `body`. If this function returns `true`, encountered issues that are matched by `issueMatcher` are considered to be known issues; if this function returns `false`, `issueMatcher` is not called and they are treated as unknown.

`issueMatcher`

A function to invoke when an issue occurs that is used to determine if the issue is known to occur. By default, all issues match.

## [Mentioned in](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:sourcelocation:_:when:matching:)\#mentions)

[Migrating a test from XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest)

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:sourcelocation:_:when:matching:)\#discussion)

Use this function when a test is known to raise one or more issues that should not cause the test to fail, or if a precondition affects whether issues are known to occur. For example:

```
@Test func example() throws {
  try withKnownIssue {
    try flakyCall()
  } when: {
    callsAreFlakyOnThisPlatform()
  } matching: { issue in
    issue.error is FileNotFoundError
  }
}

```

It is not necessary to specify both `precondition` and `issueMatcher` if only one is relevant. If all errors and issues should be considered known issues, use [`withKnownIssue(_:isIntermittent:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:sourcelocation:_:)) instead.

With Swift Testing you leverage powerful and expressive capabilities of the Swift programming language to develop tests with more confidence and less code. The library integrates seamlessly with Swift Package Manager testing workflow, supports flexible test organization, customizable metadata, and scalable test execution.

- Define test functions almost anywhere with a single attribute.

- Group related tests into hierarchies using Swift’s type system.

- Integrate seamlessly with Swift concurrency.

- Parameterize test functions across wide ranges of inputs.

- Enable tests dynamically depending on runtime conditions.

- Parallelize tests in-process.

- Categorize tests using tags.

# Adding tags to tests

Use tags to provide semantic information for organization, filtering, and customizing appearances.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/addingtags\#Overview)

A complex package or project may contain hundreds or thousands of tests and suites. Some subset of those tests may share some common facet, such as being _critical_ or _flaky_. The testing library includes a type of trait called _tags_ that you can add to group and categorize tests.

Tags are different from test suites: test suites impose structure on test functions at the source level, while tags provide semantic information for a test that can be shared with any number of other tests across test suites, source files, and even test targets.

## [Add a tag](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/addingtags\#Add-a-tag)

To add a tag to a test, use the [`tags(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/tags(_:)) trait. This trait takes a sequence of tags as its argument, and those tags are then applied to the corresponding test at runtime. If any tags are applied to a test suite, then all tests in that suite inherit those tags.

The testing library doesn’t assign any semantic meaning to any tags, nor does the presence or absence of tags affect how the testing library runs tests.

Tags themselves are instances of [`Tag`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/tag) and expressed as named constants declared as static members of [`Tag`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/tag). To declare a named constant tag, use the [`Tag()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/tag()) macro:

```
extension Tag {
  @Tag static var legallyRequired: Self
}

@Test("Vendor's license is valid", .tags(.legallyRequired))
func licenseValid() { ... }

```

If two tags with the same name ( `legallyRequired` in the above example) are declared in different files, modules, or other contexts, the testing library treats them as equivalent.

If it’s important for a tag to be distinguished from similar tags declared elsewhere in a package or project (or its dependencies), use reverse-DNS naming to create a unique Swift symbol name for your tag:

```
extension Tag {
  enum com_example_foodtruck {}
}

extension Tag.com_example_foodtruck {
  @Tag static var extraSpecial: Tag
}

@Test(
  "Extra Special Sauce recipe is secret",
  .tags(.com_example_foodtruck.extraSpecial)
)
func secretSauce() { ... }

```

### [Where tags can be declared](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/addingtags\#Where-tags-can-be-declared)

Tags must always be declared as members of [`Tag`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/tag) in an extension to that type or in a type nested within [`Tag`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/tag). Redeclaring a tag under a second name has no effect and the additional name will not be recognized by the testing library. The following example is unsupported:

```
extension Tag {
  @Tag static var legallyRequired: Self // ✅ OK: Declaring a new tag.

  static var requiredByLaw: Self { // ❌ ERROR: This tag name isn't
                                   // recognized at runtime.
    legallyRequired
  }
}

```

If a tag is declared as a named constant outside of an extension to the [`Tag`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/tag) type (for example, at the root of a file or in another unrelated type declaration), it cannot be applied to test functions or test suites. The following declarations are unsupported:

```
@Tag let needsKetchup: Self // ❌ ERROR: Tags must be declared in an extension
                            // to Tag.
struct Food {
  @Tag var needsMustard: Self // ❌ ERROR: Tags must be declared in an extension
                              // to Tag.
}

```

# Adding comments to tests

Add comments to provide useful information about tests.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/addingcomments\#Overview)

It’s often useful to add comments to code to:

- Provide context or background information about the code’s purpose

- Explain how complex code implemented

- Include details which may be helpful when diagnosing issues


Test code is no different and can benefit from explanatory code comments, but often test issues are shown in places where the source code of the test is unavailable such as in continuous integration (CI) interfaces or in log files.

Seeing comments related to tests in these contexts can help diagnose issues more quickly. Comments can be added to test declarations and the testing library will automatically capture and show them when issues are recorded.

## [Add a code comment to a test](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/addingcomments\#Add-a-code-comment-to-a-test)

To include a comment on a test or suite, write an ordinary Swift code comment immediately before its `@Test` or `@Suite` attribute:

```
// Assumes the standard lunch menu includes a taco
@Test func lunchMenu() {
  let foodTruck = FoodTruck(
    menu: .lunch,
    ingredients: [.tortillas, .cheese]
  )
  #expect(foodTruck.menu.contains { $0 is Taco })
}

```

The comment, `// Assumes the standard lunch menu includes a taco`, is added to the test.

The following language comment styles are supported:

| Syntax | Style |
| --- | --- |
| `// ...` | Line comment |
| `/// ...` | Documentation line comment |
| `/* ... */` | Block comment |
| `/** ... */` | Documentation block comment |

### [Comment formatting](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/addingcomments\#Comment-formatting)

Test comments which are automatically added from source code comments preserve their original formatting, including any prefixes like `//` or `/**`. This is because the whitespace and formatting of comments can be meaningful in some circumstances or aid in understanding the comment — for example, when a comment includes an example code snippet or diagram.

## [Use test comments effectively](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/addingcomments\#Use-test-comments-effectively)

As in normal code, comments on tests are generally most useful when they:

- Add information that isn’t obvious from reading the code

- Provide useful information about the operation or motivation of a test


If a test is related to a bug or issue, consider using the [`Bug`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/bug) trait instead of comments. For more information, see [Associating bugs with tests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/associatingbugs).

# Organizing test functions with suite types

Organize tests into test suites.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests\#Overview)

When working with a large selection of test functions, it can be helpful to organize them into test suites.

A test function can be added to a test suite in one of two ways:

- By placing it in a Swift type.

- By placing it in a Swift type and annotating that type with the `@Suite` attribute.


The `@Suite` attribute isn’t required for the testing library to recognize that a type contains test functions, but adding it allows customization of a test suite’s appearance in the IDE and at the command line. If a trait such as [`tags(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/tags(_:)) or [`disabled(_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/disabled(_:sourcelocation:)) is applied to a test suite, it’s automatically inherited by the tests contained in the suite.

In addition to containing test functions and any other members that a Swift type might contain, test suite types can also contain additional test suites nested within them. To add a nested test suite type, simply declare an additional type within the scope of the outer test suite type.

By default, tests contained within a suite run in parallel with each other. For more information about test parallelization, see [Running tests serially or in parallel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelization).

### [Customize a suite’s name](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests\#Customize-a-suites-name)

To customize a test suite’s name, supply a string literal as an argument to the `@Suite` attribute:

```
@Suite("Food truck tests") struct FoodTruckTests {
  @Test func foodTruckExists() { ... }
}

```

To further customize the appearance and behavior of a test function, use [traits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/traits) such as [`tags(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/tags(_:)).

## [Test functions in test suite types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests\#Test-functions-in-test-suite-types)

If a type contains a test function declared as an instance method (that is, without either the `static` or `class` keyword), the testing library calls that test function at runtime by initializing an instance of the type, then calling the test function on that instance. If a test suite type contains multiple test functions declared as instance methods, each one is called on a distinct instance of the type. Therefore, the following test suite and test function:

```
@Suite struct FoodTruckTests {
  @Test func foodTruckExists() { ... }
}

```

Are equivalent to:

```
@Suite struct FoodTruckTests {
  func foodTruckExists() { ... }

  @Test static func staticFoodTruckExists() {
    let instance = FoodTruckTests()
    instance.foodTruckExists()
  }
}

```

### [Constraints on test suite types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests\#Constraints-on-test-suite-types)

When using a type as a test suite, it’s subject to some constraints that are not otherwise applied to Swift types.

#### [An initializer may be required](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests\#An-initializer-may-be-required)

If a type contains test functions declared as instance methods, it must be possible to initialize an instance of the type with a zero-argument initializer. The initializer may be any combination of:

- implicit or explicit

- synchronous or asynchronous

- throwing or non-throwing

- `private`, `fileprivate`, `internal`, `package`, or `public`


For example:

```
@Suite struct FoodTruckTests {
  var batteryLevel = 100

  @Test func foodTruckExists() { ... } // ✅ OK: The type has an implicit init().
}

@Suite struct CashRegisterTests {
  private init(cashOnHand: Decimal = 0.0) async throws { ... }

  @Test func calculateSalesTax() { ... } // ✅ OK: The type has a callable init().
}

struct MenuTests {
  var foods: [Food]
  var prices: [Food: Decimal]

  @Test static func specialOfTheDay() { ... } // ✅ OK: The function is static.
  @Test func orderAllFoods() { ... } // ❌ ERROR: The suite type requires init().
}

```

The compiler emits an error when presented with a test suite that doesn’t meet this requirement.

### [Test suite types must always be available](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests\#Test-suite-types-must-always-be-available)

Although `@available` can be applied to a test function to limit its availability at runtime, a test suite type (and any types that contain it) must _not_ be annotated with the `@available` attribute:

```
@Suite struct FoodTruckTests { ... } // ✅ OK: The type is always available.

@available(macOS 11.0, *) // ❌ ERROR: The suite type must always be available.
@Suite struct CashRegisterTests { ... }

@available(macOS 11.0, *) struct MenuItemTests { // ❌ ERROR: The suite type's
                                                 // containing type must always
                                                 // be available too.
  @Suite struct BurgerTests { ... }
}

```

The compiler emits an error when presented with a test suite that doesn’t meet this requirement.

[Implementing parameterized tests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting)

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customtestargumentencodable\#overview)

The testing library checks whether a test argument conforms to this protocol, or any of several other known protocols, when running selected test cases. When a test argument conforms to this protocol, that conformance takes highest priority, and the testing library will then call [`encodeTestArgument(to:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customtestargumentencodable/encodetestargument(to:)) on the argument. A type that conforms to this protocol is not required to conform to either `Encodable` or `Decodable`.

See [Implementing parameterized tests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting) for a list of the other supported ways to allow running selected test cases.

## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customtestargumentencodable\#topics)

# Defining test functions

Define a test function to validate that code is working correctly.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/definingtests\#Overview)

Defining a test function for a Swift package or project is straightforward.

### [Import the testing library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/definingtests\#Import-the-testing-library)

To import the testing library, add the following to the Swift source file that contains the test:

```
import Testing

```

### [Declare a test function](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/definingtests\#Declare-a-test-function)

To declare a test function, write a Swift function declaration that doesn’t take any arguments, then prefix its name with the `@Test` attribute:

```
@Test func foodTruckExists() {
  // Test logic goes here.
}

```

This test function can be present at file scope or within a type. A type containing test functions is automatically a _test suite_ and can be optionally annotated with the `@Suite` attribute. For more information about suites, see [Organizing test functions with suite types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests).

Note that, while this function is a valid test function, it doesn’t actually perform any action or test any code. To check for expected values and outcomes in test functions, add [expectations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expectations) to the test function.

### [Customize a test’s name](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/definingtests\#Customize-a-tests-name)

To customize a test function’s name as presented in an IDE or at the command line, supply a string literal as an argument to the `@Test` attribute:

```
@Test("Food truck exists") func foodTruckExists() { ... }

```

To further customize the appearance and behavior of a test function, use [traits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/traits) such as [`tags(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/tags(_:)).

### [Write concurrent or throwing tests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/definingtests\#Write-concurrent-or-throwing-tests)

As with other Swift functions, test functions can be marked `async` and `throws` to annotate them as concurrent or throwing, respectively. If a test is only safe to run in the main actor’s execution context (that is, from the main thread of the process), it can be annotated `@MainActor`:

```
@Test @MainActor func foodTruckExists() async throws { ... }

```

### [Limit the availability of a test](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/definingtests\#Limit-the-availability-of-a-test)

If a test function can only run on newer versions of an operating system or of the Swift language, use the `@available` attribute when declaring it. Use the `message` argument of the `@available` attribute to specify a message to log if a test is unable to run due to limited availability:

```
@available(macOS 11.0, *)
@available(swift, introduced: 8.0, message: "Requires Swift 8.0 features to run")
@Test func foodTruckExists() { ... }

```

# Interpreting bug identifiers

Examine how the testing library interprets bug identifiers provided by developers.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/bugidentifiers\#Overview)

The testing library supports two distinct ways to identify a bug:

1. A URL linking to more information about the bug; and

2. A unique identifier in the bug’s associated bug-tracking system.


A bug may have both an associated URL _and_ an associated unique identifier. It must have at least one or the other in order for the testing library to be able to interpret it correctly.

To create an instance of [`Bug`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/bug) with a URL, use the [`bug(_:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:_:)) trait. At compile time, the testing library will validate that the given string can be parsed as a URL according to [RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt).

To create an instance of [`Bug`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/bug) with a bug’s unique identifier, use the [`bug(_:id:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:id:_:)-10yf5) trait. The testing library does not require that a bug’s unique identifier match any particular format, but will interpret unique identifiers starting with `"FB"` as referring to bugs tracked with the [Apple Feedback Assistant](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/). For convenience, you can also directly pass an integer as a bug’s identifier using [`bug(_:id:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:id:_:)-3vtpl).

### [Examples](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/bugidentifiers\#Examples)

| Trait Function | Inferred Bug-Tracking System |
| --- | --- |
| `.bug(id: 12345)` | None |
| `.bug(id: "12345")` | None |
| `.bug("https://www.example.com?id=12345", id: "12345")` | None |

# Limiting the running time of tests

Set limits on how long a test can run for until it fails.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/limitingexecutiontime\#Overview)

Some tests may naturally run slowly: they may require significant system resources to complete, may rely on downloaded data from a server, or may otherwise be dependent on external factors.

If a test may hang indefinitely or may consume too many system resources to complete effectively, consider setting a time limit for it so that it’s marked as failing if it runs for an excessive amount of time. Use the [`timeLimit(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/timelimit(_:)) trait as an upper bound:

```
@Test(.timeLimit(.minutes(60))
func serve100CustomersInOneHour() async {
  for _ in 0 ..< 100 {
    let customer = await Customer.next()
    await customer.order()
    ...
  }
}

```

If the above test function takes longer than an hour (60 x 60 seconds) to execute, the task in which it’s running is [cancelled](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task/cancel()) and the test fails with an issue of kind [`Issue.Kind.timeLimitExceeded(timeLimitComponents:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/issue/kind-swift.enum/timelimitexceeded(timelimitcomponents:)).

The testing library may adjust the specified time limit for performance reasons or to ensure tests have enough time to run. In particular, a granularity of (by default) one minute is applied to tests. The testing library can also be configured with a maximum time limit per test that overrides any applied time limit traits.

### [Time limits applied to test suites](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/limitingexecutiontime\#Time-limits-applied-to-test-suites)

When a time limit is applied to a test suite, it’s recursively applied to all test functions and child test suites within that suite.

### [Time limits applied to parameterized tests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/limitingexecutiontime\#Time-limits-applied-to-parameterized-tests)

When a time limit is applied to a parameterized test function, it’s applied to each invocation _separately_ so that if only some arguments cause failures, then successful arguments aren’t incorrectly marked as failing too.

# Implementing parameterized tests

Specify different input parameters to generate multiple test cases from a test function.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting\#Overview)

Some tests need to be run over many different inputs. For instance, a test might need to validate all cases of an enumeration. The testing library lets developers specify one or more collections to iterate over during testing, with the elements of those collections being forwarded to a test function. An invocation of a test function with a particular set of argument values is called a test _case_.

By default, the test cases of a test function run in parallel with each other. For more information about test parallelization, see [Running tests serially or in parallel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelization).

### [Parameterize over an array of values](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting\#Parameterize-over-an-array-of-values)

It is very common to want to run a test _n_ times over an array containing the values that should be tested. Consider the following test function:

```
enum Food {
  case burger, iceCream, burrito, noodleBowl, kebab
}

@Test("All foods available")
func foodsAvailable() async throws {
  for food: Food in [.burger, .iceCream, .burrito, .noodleBowl, .kebab] {
    let foodTruck = FoodTruck(selling: food)
    #expect(await foodTruck.cook(food))
  }
}

```

If this test function fails for one of the values in the array, it may be unclear which value failed. Instead, the test function can be _parameterized over_ the various inputs:

```
enum Food {
  case burger, iceCream, burrito, noodleBowl, kebab
}

@Test("All foods available", arguments: [Food.burger, .iceCream, .burrito, .noodleBowl, .kebab])
func foodAvailable(_ food: Food) async throws {
  let foodTruck = FoodTruck(selling: food)
  #expect(await foodTruck.cook(food))
}

```

When passing a collection to the `@Test` attribute for parameterization, the testing library passes each element in the collection, one at a time, to the test function as its first (and only) argument. Then, if the test fails for one or more inputs, the corresponding diagnostics can clearly indicate which inputs to examine.

### [Parameterize over the cases of an enumeration](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting\#Parameterize-over-the-cases-of-an-enumeration)

The previous example includes a hard-coded list of `Food` cases to test. If `Food` is an enumeration that conforms to `CaseIterable`, you can instead write:

```
enum Food: CaseIterable {
  case burger, iceCream, burrito, noodleBowl, kebab
}

@Test("All foods available", arguments: Food.allCases)
func foodAvailable(_ food: Food) async throws {
  let foodTruck = FoodTruck(selling: food)
  #expect(await foodTruck.cook(food))
}

```

This way, if a new case is added to the `Food` enumeration, it’s automatically tested by this function.

### [Parameterize over a range of integers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting\#Parameterize-over-a-range-of-integers)

It is possible to parameterize a test function over a closed range of integers:

```
@Test("Can make large orders", arguments: 1 ... 100)
func makeLargeOrder(count: Int) async throws {
  let foodTruck = FoodTruck(selling: .burger)
  #expect(await foodTruck.cook(.burger, quantity: count))
}

```

### [Test with more than one collection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting\#Test-with-more-than-one-collection)

It’s possible to test more than one collection. Consider the following test function:

```
@Test("Can make large orders", arguments: Food.allCases, 1 ... 100)
func makeLargeOrder(of food: Food, count: Int) async throws {
  let foodTruck = FoodTruck(selling: food)
  #expect(await foodTruck.cook(food, quantity: count))
}

```

Elements from the first collection are passed as the first argument to the test function, elements from the second collection are passed as the second argument, and so forth.

Assuming there are five cases in the `Food` enumeration, this test function will, when run, be invoked 500 times (5 x 100) with every possible combination of food and order size. These combinations are referred to as the collections’ Cartesian product.

To avoid the combinatoric semantics shown above, use [`zip()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/zip(_:_:)):

```
@Test("Can make large orders", arguments: zip(Food.allCases, 1 ... 100))
func makeLargeOrder(of food: Food, count: Int) async throws {
  let foodTruck = FoodTruck(selling: food)
  #expect(await foodTruck.cook(food, quantity: count))
}

```

The zipped sequence will be “destructured” into two arguments automatically, then passed to the test function for evaluation.

This revised test function is invoked once for each tuple in the zipped sequence, for a total of five invocations instead of 500 invocations. In other words, this test function is passed the inputs `(.burger, 1)`, `(.iceCream, 2)`, …, `(.kebab, 5)` instead of `(.burger, 1)`, `(.burger, 2)`, `(.burger, 3)`, …, `(.kebab, 99)`, `(.kebab, 100)`.

### [Run selected test cases](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parameterizedtesting\#Run-selected-test-cases)

If a parameterized test meets certain requirements, the testing library allows people to run specific test cases it contains. This can be useful when a test has many cases but only some are failing since it enables re-running and debugging the failing cases in isolation.

To support running selected test cases, it must be possible to deterministically match the test case’s arguments. When someone attempts to run selected test cases of a parameterized test function, the testing library evaluates each argument of the tests’ cases for conformance to one of several known protocols, and if all arguments of a test case conform to one of those protocols, that test case can be run selectively. The following lists the known protocols, in precedence order (highest to lowest):

1. [`CustomTestArgumentEncodable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customtestargumentencodable)

2. `RawRepresentable`, where `RawValue` conforms to `Encodable`

3. `Encodable`

4. `Identifiable`, where `ID` conforms to `Encodable`


If any argument of a test case doesn’t meet one of the above requirements, then the overall test case cannot be run selectively.

Protocol

# CustomTestStringConvertible

A protocol describing types with a custom string representation when presented as part of a test’s output.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalystmacOStvOSvisionOSwatchOSSwift 6.0+Xcode 16.0+

```
protocol CustomTestStringConvertible
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customteststringconvertible\#overview)

Values whose types conform to this protocol use it to describe themselves when they are present as part of the output of a test. For example, this protocol affects the display of values that are passed as arguments to test functions or that are elements of an expectation failure.

By default, the testing library converts values to strings using `String(describing:)`. The resulting string may be inappropriate for some types and their values. If the type of the value is made to conform to [`CustomTestStringConvertible`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customteststringconvertible), then the value of its [`testDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customteststringconvertible/testdescription) property will be used instead.

For example, consider the following type:

```
enum Food: CaseIterable {
  case paella, oden, ragu
}

```

If an array of cases from this enumeration is passed to a parameterized test function:

```
@Test(arguments: Food.allCases)
func isDelicious(_ food: Food) { ... }

```

Then the values in the array need to be presented in the test output, but the default description of a value may not be adequately descriptive:

```
◇ Passing argument food → .paella to isDelicious(_:)
◇ Passing argument food → .oden to isDelicious(_:)
◇ Passing argument food → .ragu to isDelicious(_:)

```

By adopting [`CustomTestStringConvertible`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customteststringconvertible), customized descriptions can be included:

```
extension Food: CustomTestStringConvertible {
  var testDescription: String {
    switch self {
    case .paella:
      "paella valenciana"
    case .oden:
      "おでん"
    case .ragu:
      "ragù alla bolognese"
    }
  }
}

```

The presentation of these values will then reflect the value of the [`testDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/customteststringconvertible/testdescription) property:

```
◇ Passing argument food → paella valenciana to isDelicious(_:)
◇ Passing argument food → おでん to isDelicious(_:)
◇ Passing argument food → ragù alla bolognese to isDelicious(_:)

```

## Migrating from XCTest

Article

# Migrating a test from XCTest

Migrate an existing test method or test class written using XCTest.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Overview)

The testing library provides much of the same functionality of XCTest, but uses its own syntax to declare test functions and types. Here, you’ll learn how to convert XCTest-based content to use the testing library instead.

### [Import the testing library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Import-the-testing-library)

XCTest and the testing library are available from different modules. Instead of importing the XCTest module, import the Testing module:

```
// Before
import XCTest

```

```
// After
import Testing

```

A single source file can contain tests written with XCTest as well as other tests written with the testing library. Import both XCTest and Testing if a source file contains mixed test content.

### [Convert test classes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Convert-test-classes)

XCTest groups related sets of test methods in test classes: classes that inherit from the [`XCTestCase`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestcase) class provided by the [XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest) framework. The testing library doesn’t require that test functions be instance members of types. Instead, they can be _free_ or _global_ functions, or can be `static` or `class` members of a type.

If you want to group your test functions together, you can do so by placing them in a Swift type. The testing library refers to such a type as a _suite_. These types do _not_ need to be classes, and they don’t inherit from `XCTestCase`.

To convert a subclass of `XCTestCase` to a suite, remove the `XCTestCase` conformance. It’s also generally recommended that a Swift structure or actor be used instead of a class because it allows the Swift compiler to better-enforce concurrency safety:

```
// Before
class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
  ...
}

```

```
// After
struct FoodTruckTests {
  ...
}

```

For more information about suites and how to declare and customize them, see [Organizing test functions with suite types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/organizingtests).

### [Convert setup and teardown functions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Convert-setup-and-teardown-functions)

In XCTest, code can be scheduled to run before and after a test using the [`setUp()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctest/3856481-setup) and [`tearDown()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctest/3856482-teardown) family of functions. When writing tests using the testing library, implement `init()` and/or `deinit` instead:

```
// Before
class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
  var batteryLevel: NSNumber!
  override func setUp() async throws {
    batteryLevel = 100
  }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
struct FoodTruckTests {
  var batteryLevel: NSNumber
  init() async throws {
    batteryLevel = 100
  }
  ...
}

```

The use of `async` and `throws` is optional. If teardown is needed, declare your test suite as a class or as an actor rather than as a structure and implement `deinit`:

```
// Before
class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
  var batteryLevel: NSNumber!
  override func setUp() async throws {
    batteryLevel = 100
  }
  override func tearDown() {
    batteryLevel = 0 // drain the battery
  }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
final class FoodTruckTests {
  var batteryLevel: NSNumber
  init() async throws {
    batteryLevel = 100
  }
  deinit {
    batteryLevel = 0 // drain the battery
  }
  ...
}

```

### [Convert test methods](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Convert-test-methods)

The testing library represents individual tests as functions, similar to how they are represented in XCTest. However, the syntax for declaring a test function is different. In XCTest, a test method must be a member of a test class and its name must start with `test`. The testing library doesn’t require a test function to have any particular name. Instead, it identifies a test function by the presence of the `@Test` attribute:

```
// Before
class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
  func testEngineWorks() { ... }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
struct FoodTruckTests {
  @Test func engineWorks() { ... }
  ...
}

```

As with XCTest, the testing library allows test functions to be marked `async`, `throws`, or `async`- `throws`, and to be isolated to a global actor (for example, by using the `@MainActor` attribute.)

For more information about test functions and how to declare and customize them, see [Defining test functions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/definingtests).

### [Check for expected values and outcomes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Check-for-expected-values-and-outcomes)

XCTest uses a family of approximately 40 functions to assert test requirements. These functions are collectively referred to as [`XCTAssert()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/1500669-xctassert). The testing library has two replacements, [`expect(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expect(_:_:sourcelocation:)) and [`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q). They both behave similarly to `XCTAssert()` except that [`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q) throws an error if its condition isn’t met:

```
// Before
func testEngineWorks() throws {
  let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
  XCTAssertNotNil(engine.parts.first)
  XCTAssertGreaterThan(engine.batteryLevel, 0)
  try engine.start()
  XCTAssertTrue(engine.isRunning)
}

```

```
// After
@Test func engineWorks() throws {
  let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
  try #require(engine.parts.first != nil)
  #expect(engine.batteryLevel > 0)
  try engine.start()
  #expect(engine.isRunning)
}

```

### [Check for optional values](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Check-for-optional-values)

XCTest also has a function, [`XCTUnwrap()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3380195-xctunwrap), that tests if an optional value is `nil` and throws an error if it is. When using the testing library, you can use [`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-6w9oo) with optional expressions to unwrap them:

```
// Before
func testEngineWorks() throws {
  let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
  let part = try XCTUnwrap(engine.parts.first)
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func engineWorks() throws {
  let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
  let part = try #require(engine.parts.first)
  ...
}

```

### [Record issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Record-issues)

XCTest has a function, [`XCTFail()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/1500970-xctfail), that causes a test to fail immediately and unconditionally. This function is useful when the syntax of the language prevents the use of an `XCTAssert()` function. To record an unconditional issue using the testing library, use the [`record(_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/issue/record(_:sourcelocation:)) function:

```
// Before
func testEngineWorks() {
  let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
  guard case .electric = engine else {
    XCTFail("Engine is not electric")
    return
  }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func engineWorks() {
  let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
  guard case .electric = engine else {
    Issue.record("Engine is not electric")
    return
  }
  ...
}

```

The following table includes a list of the various `XCTAssert()` functions and their equivalents in the testing library:

| XCTest | Swift Testing |
| --- | --- |
| `XCTAssert(x)`, `XCTAssertTrue(x)` | `#expect(x)` |
| `XCTAssertFalse(x)` | `#expect(!x)` |
| `XCTAssertNil(x)` | `#expect(x == nil)` |
| `XCTAssertNotNil(x)` | `#expect(x != nil)` |
| `XCTAssertEqual(x, y)` | `#expect(x == y)` |
| `XCTAssertNotEqual(x, y)` | `#expect(x != y)` |
| `XCTAssertIdentical(x, y)` | `#expect(x === y)` |
| `XCTAssertNotIdentical(x, y)` | `#expect(x !== y)` |
| `XCTAssertGreaterThan(x, y)` | `#expect(x > y)` |
| `XCTAssertGreaterThanOrEqual(x, y)` | `#expect(x >= y)` |
| `XCTAssertLessThanOrEqual(x, y)` | `#expect(x <= y)` |
| `XCTAssertLessThan(x, y)` | `#expect(x < y)` |
| `XCTAssertThrowsError(try f())` | `#expect(throws: (any Error).self) { try f() }` |
| `XCTAssertThrowsError(try f()) { error in … }` | `let error = #expect(throws: (any Error).self) { try f() }` |
| `XCTAssertNoThrow(try f())` | `#expect(throws: Never.self) { try f() }` |
| `try XCTUnwrap(x)` | `try #require(x)` |
| `XCTFail("…")` | `Issue.record("…")` |

The testing library doesn’t provide an equivalent of [`XCTAssertEqual(_:_:accuracy:_:file:line:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3551607-xctassertequal). To compare two numeric values within a specified accuracy, use `isApproximatelyEqual()` from [swift-numerics](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics).

### [Continue or halt after test failures](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Continue-or-halt-after-test-failures)

An instance of an `XCTestCase` subclass can set its [`continueAfterFailure`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestcase/1496260-continueafterfailure) property to `false` to cause a test to stop running after a failure occurs. XCTest stops an affected test by throwing an Objective-C exception at the time the failure occurs.

The behavior of an exception thrown through a Swift stack frame is undefined. If an exception is thrown through an `async` Swift function, it typically causes the process to terminate abnormally, preventing other tests from running.

The testing library doesn’t use exceptions to stop test functions. Instead, use the [`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q) macro, which throws a Swift error on failure:

```
// Before
func testTruck() async {
  continueAfterFailure = false
  XCTAssertTrue(FoodTruck.shared.isLicensed)
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func truck() throws {
  try #require(FoodTruck.shared.isLicensed)
  ...
}

```

When using either `continueAfterFailure` or [`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q), other tests will continue to run after the failed test method or test function.

### [Validate asynchronous behaviors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Validate-asynchronous-behaviors)

XCTest has a class, [`XCTestExpectation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestexpectation), that represents some asynchronous condition. You create an instance of this class (or a subclass like [`XCTKeyPathExpectation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctkeypathexpectation)) using an initializer or a convenience method on `XCTestCase`. When the condition represented by an expectation occurs, the developer _fulfills_ the expectation. Concurrently, the developer _waits for_ the expectation to be fulfilled using an instance of [`XCTWaiter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctwaiter) or using a convenience method on `XCTestCase`.

Wherever possible, prefer to use Swift concurrency to validate asynchronous conditions. For example, if it’s necessary to determine the result of an asynchronous Swift function, it can be awaited with `await`. For a function that takes a completion handler but which doesn’t use `await`, a Swift [continuation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/withcheckedcontinuation(function:_:)) can be used to convert the call into an `async`-compatible one.

Some tests, especially those that test asynchronously-delivered events, cannot be readily converted to use Swift concurrency. The testing library offers functionality called _confirmations_ which can be used to implement these tests. Instances of [`Confirmation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation) are created and used within the scope of the functions [`confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-5mqz2) and [`confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-l3il).

Confirmations function similarly to the expectations API of XCTest, however, they don’t block or suspend the caller while waiting for a condition to be fulfilled. Instead, the requirement is expected to be _confirmed_ (the equivalent of _fulfilling_ an expectation) before `confirmation()` returns, and records an issue otherwise:

```
// Before
func testTruckEvents() async {
  let soldFood = expectation(description: "…")
  FoodTruck.shared.eventHandler = { event in
    if case .soldFood = event {
      soldFood.fulfill()
    }
  }
  await Customer().buy(.soup)
  await fulfillment(of: [soldFood])
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func truckEvents() async {
  await confirmation("…") { soldFood in
    FoodTruck.shared.eventHandler = { event in
      if case .soldFood = event {
        soldFood()
      }
    }
    await Customer().buy(.soup)
  }
  ...
}

```

By default, `XCTestExpectation` expects to be fulfilled exactly once, and will record an issue in the current test if it is not fulfilled or if it is fulfilled more than once. `Confirmation` behaves the same way and expects to be confirmed exactly once by default. You can configure the number of times an expectation should be fulfilled by setting its [`expectedFulfillmentCount`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestexpectation/2806572-expectedfulfillmentcount) property, and you can pass a value for the `expectedCount` argument of [`confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-5mqz2) for the same purpose.

`XCTestExpectation` has a property, [`assertForOverFulfill`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestexpectation/2806575-assertforoverfulfill), which when set to `false` allows an expectation to be fulfilled more times than expected without causing a test failure. When using a confirmation, you can pass a range to [`confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-l3il) as its expected count to indicate that it must be confirmed _at least_ some number of times:

```
// Before
func testRegularCustomerOrders() async {
  let soldFood = expectation(description: "…")
  soldFood.expectedFulfillmentCount = 10
  soldFood.assertForOverFulfill = false
  FoodTruck.shared.eventHandler = { event in
    if case .soldFood = event {
      soldFood.fulfill()
    }
  }
  for customer in regularCustomers() {
    await customer.buy(customer.regularOrder)
  }
  await fulfillment(of: [soldFood])
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func regularCustomerOrders() async {
  await confirmation(
    "…",
    expectedCount: 10...
  ) { soldFood in
    FoodTruck.shared.eventHandler = { event in
      if case .soldFood = event {
        soldFood()
      }
    }
    for customer in regularCustomers() {
      await customer.buy(customer.regularOrder)
    }
  }
  ...
}

```

Any range expression with a lower bound (that is, whose type conforms to both [`RangeExpression<Int>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rangeexpression) and [`Sequence<Int>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence)) can be used with [`confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-l3il). You must specify a lower bound for the number of confirmations because, without one, the testing library cannot tell if an issue should be recorded when there have been zero confirmations.

### [Control whether a test runs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Control-whether-a-test-runs)

When using XCTest, the [`XCTSkip`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctskip) error type can be thrown to bypass the remainder of a test function. As well, the [`XCTSkipIf()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3521325-xctskipif) and [`XCTSkipUnless()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3521326-xctskipunless) functions can be used to conditionalize the same action. The testing library allows developers to skip a test function or an entire test suite before it starts running using the [`ConditionTrait`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/conditiontrait) trait type. Annotate a test suite or test function with an instance of this trait type to control whether it runs:

```
// Before
class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
  func testArepasAreTasty() throws {
    try XCTSkipIf(CashRegister.isEmpty)
    try XCTSkipUnless(FoodTruck.sells(.arepas))
    ...
  }

}

```

```

```

### [Annotate known issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Annotate-known-issues)

A test may have a known issue that sometimes or always prevents it from passing. When written using XCTest, such tests can call [`XCTExpectFailure(_:options:failingBlock:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3727246-xctexpectfailure) to tell XCTest and its infrastructure that the issue shouldn’t cause the test to fail. The testing library has an equivalent function with synchronous and asynchronous variants:

- [`withKnownIssue(_:isIntermittent:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:sourcelocation:_:))

- [`withKnownIssue(_:isIntermittent:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:isolation:sourcelocation:_:))


This function can be used to annotate a section of a test as having a known issue:

```
// Before
func testGrillWorks() async {
  XCTExpectFailure("Grill is out of fuel") {
    try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
  }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func grillWorks() async {
  withKnownIssue("Grill is out of fuel") {
    try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
  }
  ...
}

```

If a test may fail intermittently, the call to `XCTExpectFailure(_:options:failingBlock:)` can be marked _non-strict_. When using the testing library, specify that the known issue is _intermittent_ instead:

```
// Before
func testGrillWorks() async {
  XCTExpectFailure(
    "Grill may need fuel",
    options: .nonStrict()
  ) {
    try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
  }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func grillWorks() async {
  withKnownIssue(
    "Grill may need fuel",
    isIntermittent: true
  ) {
    try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
  }
  ...
}

```

Additional options can be specified when calling `XCTExpectFailure()`:

- [`isEnabled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctexpectedfailure/options/3726085-isenabled) can be set to `false` to skip known-issue matching (for instance, if a particular issue only occurs under certain conditions)

- [`issueMatcher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctexpectedfailure/options/3726086-issuematcher) can be set to a closure to allow marking only certain issues as known and to allow other issues to be recorded as test failures


The testing library includes overloads of `withKnownIssue()` that take additional arguments with similar behavior:

- [`withKnownIssue(_:isIntermittent:sourceLocation:_:when:matching:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:sourcelocation:_:when:matching:))

- [`withKnownIssue(_:isIntermittent:isolation:sourceLocation:_:when:matching:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:isolation:sourcelocation:_:when:matching:))


To conditionally enable known-issue matching or to match only certain kinds of issues:

```
// Before
func testGrillWorks() async {
  let options = XCTExpectedFailure.Options()
  options.isEnabled = FoodTruck.shared.hasGrill
  options.issueMatcher = { issue in
    issue.type == thrownError
  }
  XCTExpectFailure(
    "Grill is out of fuel",
    options: options
  ) {
    try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
  }
  ...
}

```

```
// After
@Test func grillWorks() async {
  withKnownIssue("Grill is out of fuel") {
    try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
  } when: {
    FoodTruck.shared.hasGrill
  } matching: { issue in
    issue.error != nil
  }
  ...
}

```

### [Run tests sequentially](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest\#Run-tests-sequentially)

By default, the testing library runs all tests in a suite in parallel. The default behavior of XCTest is to run each test in a suite sequentially. If your tests use shared state such as global variables, you may see unexpected behavior including unreliable test outcomes when you run tests in parallel.

Annotate your test suite with [`serialized`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/serialized) to run tests within that suite serially:

```
// Before
class RefrigeratorTests : XCTestCase {
  func testLightComesOn() throws {
    try FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.openDoor()
    XCTAssertEqual(FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.lightState, .on)
  }

  func testLightGoesOut() throws {
    try FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.openDoor()
    try FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.closeDoor()
    XCTAssertEqual(FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.lightState, .off)
  }
}

```

```
// After
@Suite(.serialized)
class RefrigeratorTests {
  @Test func lightComesOn() throws {
    try FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.openDoor()
    #expect(FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.lightState == .on)
  }

  @Test func lightGoesOut() throws {
    try FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.openDoor()
    try FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.closeDoor()
    #expect(FoodTruck.shared.refrigerator.lightState == .off)
  }
}

```

# ParallelizationTrait

A type that defines whether the testing library runs this test serially or in parallel.

```
struct ParallelizationTrait
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelizationtrait\#overview)

When you add this trait to a parameterized test function, that test runs its cases serially instead of in parallel. This trait has no effect when you apply it to a non-parameterized test function.

When you add this trait to a test suite, that suite runs its contained test functions (including their cases, when parameterized) and sub-suites serially instead of in parallel. If the sub-suites have children, they also run serially.

This trait does not affect the execution of a test relative to its peers or to unrelated tests. This trait has no effect if you disable test parallelization globally (for example, by passing `--no-parallel` to the `swift test` command.)

To add this trait to a test, use [`serialized`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/serialized).

# Running tests serially or in parallel

Control whether tests run serially or in parallel.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelization\#Overview)

By default, tests run in parallel with respect to each other. Parallelization is accomplished by the testing library using task groups, and tests generally all run in the same process. The number of tests that run concurrently is controlled by the Swift runtime.

## [Disabling parallelization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelization\#Disabling-parallelization)

Parallelization can be disabled on a per-function or per-suite basis using the [`serialized`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/serialized) trait:

```
@Test(.serialized, arguments: Food.allCases) func prepare(food: Food) {
  // This function will be invoked serially, once per food, because it has the
  // .serialized trait.
}

@Suite(.serialized) struct FoodTruckTests {
  @Test(arguments: Condiment.allCases) func refill(condiment: Condiment) {
    // This function will be invoked serially, once per condiment, because the
    // containing suite has the .serialized trait.
  }

  @Test func startEngine() async throws {
    // This function will not run while refill(condiment:) is running. One test
    // must end before the other will start.
  }
}

```

When added to a parameterized test function, this trait causes that test to run its cases serially instead of in parallel. When applied to a non-parameterized test function, this trait has no effect. When applied to a test suite, this trait causes that suite to run its contained test functions and sub-suites serially instead of in parallel.

This trait is recursively applied: if it is applied to a suite, any parameterized tests or test suites contained in that suite are also serialized (as are any tests contained in those suites, and so on.)

This trait doesn’t affect the execution of a test relative to its peers or to unrelated tests. This trait has no effect if test parallelization is globally disabled (by, for example, passing `--no-parallel` to the `swift test` command.)

# Enabling and disabling tests

Conditionally enable or disable individual tests before they run.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/enablinganddisabling\#Overview)

Often, a test is only applicable in specific circumstances. For instance, you might want to write a test that only runs on devices with particular hardware capabilities, or performs locale-dependent operations. The testing library allows you to add traits to your tests that cause runners to automatically skip them if conditions like these are not met.

### [Disable a test](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/enablinganddisabling\#Disable-a-test)

If you need to disable a test unconditionally, use the [`disabled(_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/disabled(_:sourcelocation:)) function. Given the following test function:

```
@Test("Food truck sells burritos")
func sellsBurritos() async throws { ... }

```

Add the trait _after_ the test’s display name:

```
@Test("Food truck sells burritos", .disabled())
func sellsBurritos() async throws { ... }

```

The test will now always be skipped.

It’s also possible to add a comment to the trait to present in the output from the runner when it skips the test:

```
@Test("Food truck sells burritos", .disabled("We only sell Thai cuisine"))
func sellsBurritos() async throws { ... }

```

### [Enable or disable a test conditionally](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/enablinganddisabling\#Enable-or-disable-a-test-conditionally)

Sometimes, it makes sense to enable a test only when a certain condition is met. Consider the following test function:

```
@Test("Ice cream is cold")
func isCold() async throws { ... }

```

If it’s currently winter, then presumably ice cream won’t be available for sale and this test will fail. It therefore makes sense to only enable it if it’s currently summer. You can conditionally enable a test with [`enabled(if:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/enabled(if:_:sourcelocation:)):

```
@Test("Ice cream is cold", .enabled(if: Season.current == .summer))
func isCold() async throws { ... }

```

It’s also possible to conditionally _disable_ a test and to combine multiple conditions:

```
@Test(
  "Ice cream is cold",
  .enabled(if: Season.current == .summer),
  .disabled("We ran out of sprinkles")
)
func isCold() async throws { ... }

```

If a test is disabled because of a problem for which there is a corresponding bug report, you can use one of these functions to show the relationship between the test and the bug report:

- [`bug(_:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:_:))

- [`bug(_:id:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:id:_:)-10yf5)

- [`bug(_:id:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:id:_:)-3vtpl)


For example, the following test cannot run due to bug number `"12345"`:

```
@Test(
  "Ice cream is cold",
  .enabled(if: Season.current == .summer),
  .disabled("We ran out of sprinkles"),
  .bug(id: "12345")
)
func isCold() async throws { ... }

```

If a test has multiple conditions applied to it, they must _all_ pass for it to run. Otherwise, the test notes the first condition to fail as the reason the test is skipped.

### [Handle complex conditions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/enablinganddisabling\#Handle-complex-conditions)

If a condition is complex, consider factoring it out into a helper function to improve readability:

```
func allIngredientsAvailable(for food: Food) -> Bool { ... }

@Test(
  "Can make sundaes",
  .enabled(if: Season.current == .summer),
  .enabled(if: allIngredientsAvailable(for: .sundae))
)
func makeSundae() async throws { ... }

```

### [Customizing runtime behaviors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/enablinganddisabling\#Customizing-runtime-behaviors)

[Limiting the running time of tests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/limitingexecutiontime)

[`static func enabled(if: @autoclosure () throws -> Bool, Comment?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation) -> Self`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/enabled(if:_:sourcelocation:))

Constructs a condition trait that disables a test if it returns `false`.

[`static func enabled(Comment?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation, () async throws -> Bool) -> Self`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/enabled(_:sourcelocation:_:))

Constructs a condition trait that disables a test if it returns `false`.

[`static func disabled(Comment?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation) -> Self`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/disabled(_:sourcelocation:))

Constructs a condition trait that disables a test unconditionally.

[`static func disabled(if: @autoclosure () throws -> Bool, Comment?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation) -> Self`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/disabled(if:_:sourcelocation:))

Constructs a condition trait that disables a test if its value is true.

[`static func disabled(Comment?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation, () async throws -> Bool) -> Self`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/disabled(_:sourcelocation:_:))

Constructs a condition trait that disables a test if its value is true.

[`static func timeLimit(TimeLimitTrait.Duration) -> Self`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/timelimit(_:))

Construct a time limit trait that causes a test to time out if it runs for too long.

API Collection

# Expectations and confirmations

Check for expected values, outcomes, and asynchronous events in tests.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expectations\#Overview)

Use [`expect(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expect(_:_:sourcelocation:)) and [`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q) macros to validate expected outcomes. To validate that an error is thrown, or _not_ thrown, the testing library provides several overloads of the macros that you can use. For more information, see [Testing for errors in Swift code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-for-errors-in-swift-code).

Use a [`Confirmation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation) to confirm the occurrence of an asynchronous event that you can’t check directly using an expectation. For more information, see [Testing asynchronous code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-asynchronous-code).

### [Validate your code’s result](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expectations\#Validate-your-codes-result)

To validate that your code produces an expected value, use [`expect(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expect(_:_:sourcelocation:)). This macro captures the expression you pass, and provides detailed information when the code doesn’t satisfy the expectation.

```
@Test func calculatingOrderTotal() {
  let calculator = OrderCalculator()
  #expect(calculator.total(of: [3, 3]) == 7)
  // Prints "Expectation failed: (calculator.total(of: [3, 3]) → 6) == 7"
}

```

Your test keeps running after [`expect(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expect(_:_:sourcelocation:)) fails. To stop the test when the code doesn’t satisfy a requirement, use [`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q) instead:

```
@Test func returningCustomerRemembersUsualOrder() throws {
  let customer = try #require(Customer(id: 123))
  // The test runner doesn't reach this line if the customer is nil.
  #expect(customer.usualOrder.countOfItems == 2)
}

```

[`require(_:_:sourceLocation:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/require(_:_:sourcelocation:)-5l63q) throws an instance of [`ExpectationFailedError`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expectationfailederror) when your code fails to satisfy the requirement.

## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expectations\#topics)

### [Checking expectations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/expectations\#Checking-expectations)

# Associating bugs with tests

Associate bugs uncovered or verified by tests.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/associatingbugs\#Overview)

Tests allow developers to prove that the code they write is working as expected. If code isn’t working correctly, bug trackers are often used to track the work necessary to fix the underlying problem. It’s often useful to associate specific bugs with tests that reproduce them or verify they are fixed.

## [Associate a bug with a test](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/associatingbugs\#Associate-a-bug-with-a-test)

To associate a bug with a test, use one of these functions:

- [`bug(_:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:_:))

- [`bug(_:id:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:id:_:)-10yf5)

- [`bug(_:id:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/bug(_:id:_:)-3vtpl)


The first argument to these functions is a URL representing the bug in its bug-tracking system:

```
@Test("Food truck engine works", .bug("https://www.example.com/issues/12345"))
func engineWorks() async {
  var foodTruck = FoodTruck()
  await foodTruck.engine.start()
  #expect(foodTruck.engine.isRunning)
}

```

You can also specify the bug’s _unique identifier_ in its bug-tracking system in addition to, or instead of, its URL:

```
@Test(
  "Food truck engine works",
  .bug(id: "12345"),
  .bug("https://www.example.com/issues/67890", id: 67890)
)
func engineWorks() async {
  var foodTruck = FoodTruck()
  await foodTruck.engine.start()
  #expect(foodTruck.engine.isRunning)
}

```

A bug’s URL is passed as a string and must be parseable according to [RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt). A bug’s unique identifier can be passed as an integer or as a string. For more information on the formats recognized by the testing library, see [Interpreting bug identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/bugidentifiers).

## [Add titles to associated bugs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/associatingbugs\#Add-titles-to-associated-bugs)

A bug’s unique identifier or URL may be insufficient to uniquely and clearly identify a bug associated with a test. Bug trackers universally provide a “title” field for bugs that is not visible to the testing library. To add a bug’s title to a test, include it after the bug’s unique identifier or URL:

```
@Test(
  "Food truck has napkins",
  .bug(id: "12345", "Forgot to buy more napkins")
)
func hasNapkins() async {
  ...
}

```

Use this type to specify a test timeout with [`TimeLimitTrait`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/timelimittrait). `TimeLimitTrait` uses this type instead of Swift’s built-in `Duration` type because the testing library doesn’t support high-precision, arbitrarily short durations for test timeouts. The smallest unit of time you can specify in a `Duration` is minutes.

# Testing asynchronous code

Validate whether your code causes expected events to happen.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-asynchronous-code\#Overview)

The testing library integrates with Swift concurrency, meaning that in many situations you can test asynchronous code using standard Swift features. Mark your test function as `async` and, in the function body, `await` any asynchronous interactions:

```
@Test func priceLookupYieldsExpectedValue() async {
  let mozarellaPrice = await unitPrice(for: .mozarella)
  #expect(mozarellaPrice == 3)
}

```

In more complex situations you can use [`Confirmation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation) to discover whether an expected event happens.

### [Confirm that an event happens](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-asynchronous-code\#Confirm-that-an-event-happens)

Call [`confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-5mqz2) in your asynchronous test function to create a `Confirmation` for the expected event. In the trailing closure parameter, call the code under test. Swift Testing passes a `Confirmation` as the parameter to the closure, which you call as a function in the event handler for the code under test when the event you’re testing for occurs:

```
@Test("OrderCalculator successfully calculates subtotal for no pizzas")
func subtotalForNoPizzas() async {
  let calculator = OrderCalculator()
  await confirmation() { confirmation in
    calculator.successHandler = { _ in confirmation() }
    _ = await calculator.subtotal(for: PizzaToppings(bases: []))
  }
}

```

If you expect the event to happen more than once, set the `expectedCount` parameter to the number of expected occurrences. The test passes if the number of occurrences during the test matches the expected count, and fails otherwise.

You can also pass a range to [`confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-l3il) if the exact number of times the event occurs may change over time or is random:

```
@Test("Customers bought sandwiches")
func boughtSandwiches() async {
  await confirmation(expectedCount: 0 ..< 1000) { boughtSandwich in
    var foodTruck = FoodTruck()
    foodTruck.orderHandler = { order in
      if order.contains(.sandwich) {
        boughtSandwich()
      }
    }
    await FoodTruck.operate()
  }
}

```

In this example, there may be zero customers or up to (but not including) 1,000 customers who order sandwiches. Any [range expression](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rangeexpression) which includes an explicit lower bound can be used:

| Range Expression | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `1...` | If an event must occur _at least_ once |
| `5...` | If an event must occur _at least_ five times |
| `1 ... 5` | If an event must occur at least once, but not more than five times |
| `0 ..< 100` | If an event may or may not occur, but _must not_ occur more than 99 times |

### [Confirm that an event doesn’t happen](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-asynchronous-code\#Confirm-that-an-event-doesnt-happen)

To validate that a particular event doesn’t occur during a test, create a `Confirmation` with an expected count of `0`:

```
@Test func orderCalculatorEncountersNoErrors() async {
  let calculator = OrderCalculator()
  await confirmation(expectedCount: 0) { confirmation in
    calculator.errorHandler = { _ in confirmation() }
    calculator.subtotal(for: PizzaToppings(bases: []))
  }
}

```

### [Confirming that asynchronous events occur](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-asynchronous-code\#Confirming-that-asynchronous-events-occur)

[`func confirmation<R>(Comment?, expectedCount: Int, isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation, (Confirmation) async throws -> sending R) async rethrows -> R`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-5mqz2)

Confirm that some event occurs during the invocation of a function.

[`func confirmation<R>(Comment?, expectedCount: some RangeExpression<Int> & Sendable & Sequence<Int>, isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, sourceLocation: SourceLocation, (Confirmation) async throws -> sending R) async rethrows -> R`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)-l3il)

Confirm that some event occurs during the invocation of a function.

[`struct Confirmation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation)

A type that can be used to confirm that an event occurs zero or more times.

# ParallelizationTrait

A type that defines whether the testing library runs this test serially or in parallel.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalystmacOStvOSvisionOSwatchOSSwift 6.0+Xcode 16.0+

```
struct ParallelizationTrait
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelizationtrait?changes=__2\#overview)

When you add this trait to a parameterized test function, that test runs its cases serially instead of in parallel. This trait has no effect when you apply it to a non-parameterized test function.

When you add this trait to a test suite, that suite runs its contained test functions (including their cases, when parameterized) and sub-suites serially instead of in parallel. If the sub-suites have children, they also run serially.

This trait does not affect the execution of a test relative to its peers or to unrelated tests. This trait has no effect if you disable test parallelization globally (for example, by passing `--no-parallel` to the `swift test` command.)

To add this trait to a test, use [`serialized`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/serialized?changes=__2).

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/comment/testscopeprovider\#discussion)

The default type is `Never`, which can’t be instantiated. The `scopeProvider(for:testCase:)-cjmg` method for any trait with `Never` as its test scope provider type must return `nil`, meaning that the trait doesn’t provide a custom scope for tests it’s applied to.

Type Method

# timeLimit(\_:)

Construct a time limit trait that causes a test to time out if it runs for too long.

static func timeLimit(_ timeLimit: TimeLimitTrait.Duration) -> Self
```

Available when `Self` is `TimeLimitTrait`.

## [Parameters](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/timelimit(_:)\#parameters)

`timeLimit`

The maximum amount of time the test may run for.

## [Return Value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/timelimit(_:)\#return-value)

An instance of [`TimeLimitTrait`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/timelimittrait).

## [Mentioned in](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/timelimit(_:)\#mentions)

[Limiting the running time of tests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/limitingexecutiontime)

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/timelimit(_:)\#discussion)

Test timeouts do not support high-precision, arbitrarily short durations due to variability in testing environments. You express the duration in minutes, with a minimum duration of one minute.

When you associate this trait with a test, that test must complete within a time limit of, at most, `timeLimit`. If the test runs longer, the testing library records a [`Issue.Kind.timeLimitExceeded(timeLimitComponents:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/issue/kind-swift.enum/timelimitexceeded(timelimitcomponents:)) issue, which it treats as a test failure.

The testing library can use a shorter time limit than that specified by `timeLimit` if you configure it to enforce a maximum per-test limit. When you configure a maximum per-test limit, the time limit of the test this trait is applied to is the shorter of `timeLimit` and the maximum per-test limit. For information on configuring maximum per-test limits, consult the documentation for the tool you use to run your tests.

If a test is parameterized, this time limit is applied to each of its test cases individually. If a test has more than one time limit associated with it, the testing library uses the shortest time limit.

```
func scopeProvider(

    testCase: Test.Case?
) -> Self.TestScopeProvider?
```

**Required** Default implementations provided.

## [Parameters](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/scopeprovider(for:testcase:)\#parameters)

`test`

The test for which a scope provider is being requested.

`testCase`

The test case for which a scope provider is being requested, if any. When `test` represents a suite, the value of this argument is `nil`.

## [Return Value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/scopeprovider(for:testcase:)\#return-value)

A value conforming to [`TestScopeProvider`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/testscopeprovider) which you use to provide custom scoping for `test` or `testCase`. Returns `nil` if the trait doesn’t provide any custom scope for the test or test case.

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/scopeprovider(for:testcase:)\#discussion)

If this trait’s type conforms to [`TestScoping`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testscoping), the default value returned by this method depends on the values of `test` and `testCase`:

- If `test` represents a suite, this trait must conform to [`SuiteTrait`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/suitetrait). If the value of this suite trait’s [`isRecursive`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/suitetrait/isrecursive) property is `true`, then this method returns `nil`, and the suite trait provides its custom scope once for each test function the test suite contains. If the value of [`isRecursive`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/suitetrait/isrecursive) is `false`, this method returns `self`, and the suite trait provides its custom scope once for the entire test suite.

- If `test` represents a test function, this trait also conforms to [`TestTrait`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testtrait). If `testCase` is `nil`, this method returns `nil`; otherwise, it returns `self`. This means that by default, a trait which is applied to or inherited by a test function provides its custom scope once for each of that function’s cases.


A trait may override this method to further customize the default behaviors above. For example, if a trait needs to provide custom test scope both once per-suite and once per-test function in that suite, it implements the method to return a non- `nil` scope provider under those conditions.

A trait may also implement this method and return `nil` if it determines that it does not need to provide a custom scope for a particular test at runtime, even if the test has the trait applied. This can improve performance and make diagnostics clearer by avoiding an unnecessary call to [`provideScope(for:testCase:performing:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testscoping/providescope(for:testcase:performing:)).

If this trait’s type does not conform to [`TestScoping`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testscoping) and its associated [`TestScopeProvider`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/testscopeprovider) type is the default `Never`, then this method returns `nil` by default. This means that instances of this trait don’t provide a custom scope for tests to which they’re applied.

## Test Execution Control

- [Traits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/traits?changes=_3)
- Running tests serially or in parallel

Article

# Running tests serially or in parallel

Control whether tests run serially or in parallel.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelization?changes=_3\#Overview)

By default, tests run in parallel with respect to each other. Parallelization is accomplished by the testing library using task groups, and tests generally all run in the same process. The number of tests that run concurrently is controlled by the Swift runtime.

## [Disabling parallelization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/parallelization?changes=_3\#Disabling-parallelization)

Parallelization can be disabled on a per-function or per-suite basis using the [`serialized`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/trait/serialized?changes=_3) trait:

```
@Test(.serialized, arguments: Food.allCases) func prepare(food: Food) {
  // This function will be invoked serially, once per food, because it has the
  // .serialized trait.
}

@Suite(.serialized) struct FoodTruckTests {
  @Test(arguments: Condiment.allCases) func refill(condiment: Condiment) {
    // This function will be invoked serially, once per condiment, because the
    // containing suite has the .serialized trait.
  }

  @Test func startEngine() async throws {
    // This function will not run while refill(condiment:) is running. One test
    // must end before the other will start.
  }
}

```

When added to a parameterized test function, this trait causes that test to run its cases serially instead of in parallel. When applied to a non-parameterized test function, this trait has no effect. When applied to a test suite, this trait causes that suite to run its contained test functions and sub-suites serially instead of in parallel.

This trait is recursively applied: if it is applied to a suite, any parameterized tests or test suites contained in that suite are also serialized (as are any tests contained in those suites, and so on.)

This trait doesn’t affect the execution of a test relative to its peers or to unrelated tests. This trait has no effect if test parallelization is globally disabled (by, for example, passing `--no-parallel` to the `swift test` command.)

```

## [Parameters](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:sourcelocation:_:)\#parameters)

`comment`

An optional comment to apply to any issues generated by this function.

`expectedCount`

The number of times the expected event should occur when `body` is invoked. The default value of this argument is `1`, indicating that the event should occur exactly once. Pass `0` if the event should _never_ occur when `body` is invoked.

[Testing asynchronous code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-asynchronous-code)

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:sourcelocation:_:)\#discussion)

Use confirmations to check that an event occurs while a test is running in complex scenarios where `#expect()` and `#require()` are insufficient. For example, a confirmation may be useful when an expected event occurs:

- In a context that cannot be awaited by the calling function such as an event handler or delegate callback;

- More than once, or never; or

- As a callback that is invoked as part of a larger operation.


To use a confirmation, pass a closure containing the work to be performed. The testing library will then pass an instance of [`Confirmation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation) to the closure. Every time the event in question occurs, the closure should call the confirmation:

```
let n = 10
await confirmation("Baked buns", expectedCount: n) { bunBaked in
  foodTruck.eventHandler = { event in
    if event == .baked(.cinnamonBun) {
      bunBaked()
    }
  }
  await foodTruck.bake(.cinnamonBun, count: n)
}

```

When the closure returns, the testing library checks if the confirmation’s preconditions have been met, and records an issue if they have not.

- [Swift Testing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing)
- withKnownIssue(\_:isIntermittent:sourceLocation:\_:when:matching:)

Function

# withKnownIssue(\_:isIntermittent:sourceLocation:\_:when:matching:)

Invoke a function that has a known issue that is expected to occur during its execution.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalystmacOStvOSvisionOSwatchOSSwift 6.0+Xcode 16.0+

```
func withKnownIssue(
    _ comment: Comment? = nil,
    isIntermittent: Bool = false,
    sourceLocation: SourceLocation = #_sourceLocation,
    _ body: () throws -> Void,
    when precondition: () -> Bool = { true },
    matching issueMatcher: @escaping KnownIssueMatcher = { _ in true }
) rethrows
```

## [Parameters](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:sourcelocation:_:when:matching:)\#parameters)

`comment`

An optional comment describing the known issue.

`isIntermittent`

Whether or not the known issue occurs intermittently. If this argument is `true` and the known issue does not occur, no secondary issue is recorded.

`sourceLocation`

The source location to which any recorded issues should be attributed.

`body`

The function to invoke.

`precondition`

A function that determines if issues are known to occur during the execution of `body`. If this function returns `true`, encountered issues that are matched by `issueMatcher` are considered to be known issues; if this function returns `false`, `issueMatcher` is not called and they are treated as unknown.

`issueMatcher`

A function to invoke when an issue occurs that is used to determine if the issue is known to occur. By default, all issues match.

## [Mentioned in](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:sourcelocation:_:when:matching:)\#mentions)

[Migrating a test from XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest)

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:sourcelocation:_:when:matching:)\#discussion)

Use this function when a test is known to raise one or more issues that should not cause the test to fail, or if a precondition affects whether issues are known to occur. For example:

```
@Test func example() throws {
  try withKnownIssue {
    try flakyCall()
  } when: {
    callsAreFlakyOnThisPlatform()
  } matching: { issue in
    issue.error is FileNotFoundError
  }
}

```

It is not necessary to specify both `precondition` and `issueMatcher` if only one is relevant. If all errors and issues should be considered known issues, use [`withKnownIssue(_:isIntermittent:sourceLocation:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:sourcelocation:_:)) instead.

A hands-on, comprehensive guide for migrating from XCTest to Swift Testing and mastering the new framework. This playbook integrates the latest patterns and best practices from WWDC 2024 and official Apple documentation to make your tests more powerful, expressive, and maintainable.

---

## **1. Migration & Tooling Baseline**

Ensure your environment is set up for a smooth, gradual migration.

| What | Why |
|---|---|
| **Xcode 16 & Swift 6** | Swift Testing is bundled with the latest toolchain. It leverages modern Swift features like macros, structured concurrency, and powerful type-system checks. |
| **Keep XCTest Targets** | **Incremental Migration is Key.** You can have XCTest and Swift Testing tests in the same target, allowing you to migrate file-by-file without breaking CI. Both frameworks can coexist. |
| **Enable Parallel Execution**| In your Test Plan, ensure "Use parallel execution" is enabled. Swift Testing runs tests in parallel by default, which dramatically speeds up test runs and helps surface hidden state dependencies that serial execution might miss. |

### Migration Action Items
- [ ] Ensure all developer machines and CI runners are on macOS 15+ and Xcode 16+.
- [ ] For projects supporting Linux/Windows, add the `swift-testing` SPM package to your `Package.swift`. It's bundled in Xcode and not needed for Apple platforms.
- [ ] For **existing test targets**, you must explicitly enable the framework. In the target's **Build Settings**, find **Enable Testing Frameworks** and set its value to **Yes**. Without this, `import Testing` will fail.
- [ ] In your primary test plan, confirm that **“Use parallel execution”** is enabled. This is the default and recommended setting.

---

## **2. Expressive Assertions: `#expect` & `#require`**

Replace the entire `XCTAssert` family with two powerful, expressive macros. They accept regular Swift expressions, eliminating the need for dozens of specialized `XCTAssert` functions.

| Macro | Use Case & Behavior |
|---|---|
| **`#expect(expression)`** | **Soft Check.** Use for most validations. If the expression is `false`, the issue is recorded, but the test function continues executing. This allows you to find multiple failures in a single run. |
| **`#require(expression)`**| **Hard Check.** Use for critical preconditions (e.g., unwrapping an optional). If the expression is `false` or throws, the test is immediately aborted. This prevents cascading failures from an invalid state. |

### Power Move: Visual Failure Diagnostics
Unlike `XCTAssert`, which often only reports that a comparison failed, `#expect` shows you the exact values that caused the failure, directly in the IDE and logs. This visual feedback is a massive productivity boost.

**Code:**
```swift
@Test("User count meets minimum requirement")
func testUserCount() {
    let userCount = 5
    // This check will fail
    #expect(userCount > 10)
}
```

**Failure Output in Xcode:**
```
▽ Expected expression to be true
#expect(userCount > 10)
      |         | |
      5         | 10
                false
```

### Power Move: Optional-Safe Unwrapping
`#require` is the new, safer replacement for `XCTUnwrap`. It not only checks for `nil` but also unwraps the value for subsequent use.

**Before: The XCTest Way**
```swift
// In an XCTestCase subclass...
func testFetchUser_XCTest() async throws {
    let user = try XCTUnwrap(await fetchUser(id: "123"), "Fetching user should not return nil")
    XCTAssertEqual(user.id, "123")
}
```

**After: The Swift Testing Way**
```swift
@Test("Fetching a valid user succeeds")
func testFetchUser() async throws {
    // #require both checks for nil and unwraps `user` in one step.
    // If fetchUser returns nil, the test stops here and fails.
    let user = try #require(await fetchUser(id: "123"))

    // `user` is now a non-optional User, ready for further assertions.
    #expect(user.id == "123")
    #expect(user.age == 37)
}
```

### Common Assertion Conversions Quick-Reference

Use this table as a cheat sheet when migrating your `XCTest` assertions.

| XCTest Assertion | Swift Testing Equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `XCTAssert(expr)` | `#expect(expr)` | Direct replacement for a boolean expression. |
| `XCTAssertEqual(a, b)` | `#expect(a == b)` | Use the standard `==` operator. |
| `XCTAssertNotEqual(a, b)`| `#expect(a != b)` | Use the standard `!=` operator. |
| `XCTAssertNil(a)` | `#expect(a == nil)` | Direct comparison to `nil`. |
| `XCTAssertNotNil(a)` | `#expect(a != nil)` | Direct comparison to `nil`. |
| `XCTAssertTrue(a)` | `#expect(a)` | No change needed if `a` is already a Bool. |
| `XCTAssertFalse(a)` | `#expect(!a)` | Use the `!` operator to negate the expression. |
| `XCTAssertGreaterThan(a, b)` | `#expect(a > b)` | Use any standard comparison operator: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` |
| `try XCTUnwrap(a)` | `try #require(a)` | The preferred, safer way to unwrap optionals. |
| `XCTAssertThrowsError(expr)` | `#expect(throws: (any Error).self) { try expr }` | The basic form for checking any error. |
| `XCTAssertNoThrow(try expr)` | `#expect(throws: Never.self) { try expr }` | The explicit way to assert that no error is thrown. |

### Action Items
- [ ] Run `grep -R "XCTAssert\|XCTUnwrap" .` to find all legacy assertions.
- [ ] Convert `try XCTUnwrap()` calls to `try #require()`. This is a direct and superior replacement.
- [ ] Convert most `XCTAssert...()` calls to `#expect()`. Use `#require()` only for preconditions where continuing the test makes no sense.
- [ ] Group related checks logically within a test. Since `#expect` continues on failure, you can naturally check multiple properties of an object in a single test.

---

## **3. Setup, Teardown, and State Lifecycle**

Swift Testing replaces `setUpWithError` and `tearDownWithError` with a more natural, type-safe lifecycle using `init()` and `deinit`.

**The Core Concept:** A fresh, new instance of the test suite (`struct` or `class`) is created for **each** test function it contains. This is the cornerstone of test isolation, guaranteeing that state from one test cannot leak into another.

| Method | Replaces... | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `init()` | `setUpWithError()` | The initializer for your suite. Put all setup code here. It can be `async` and `throws`. |
| `deinit` | `tearDownWithError()` | The deinitializer. Put cleanup code here. It runs automatically after each test. **Note:** `deinit` is only available on `class` or `actor` suite types, not `struct`s. This is a common reason to choose a class for your suite. |

### Practical Example: Migrating a Database Test Suite

**Before: The XCTest Way**
```swift
final class DatabaseServiceXCTests: XCTestCase {
    var sut: DatabaseService!
    var tempDirectory: URL!

    override func setUpWithError() throws {
        try super.setUpWithError()
        tempDirectory = FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory.appendingPathComponent(UUID().uuidString)
        try FileManager.default.createDirectory(at: tempDirectory, withIntermediateDirectories: true)
        
        let testDatabase = TestDatabase(storageURL: tempDirectory)
        sut = DatabaseService(database: testDatabase)
    }

    override func tearDownWithError() throws {
        try FileManager.default.removeItem(at: tempDirectory)
        sut = nil
        tempDirectory = nil
        try super.tearDownWithError()
    }

    func testSavingUser() throws {
        let user = User(id: "user-1", name: "Alex")
        try sut.save(user)
        let loadedUser = try sut.loadUser(id: "user-1")
        XCTAssertNotNil(loadedUser)
    }
}
```

**After: The Swift Testing Way (using `class` for `deinit`)**
```swift
@Suite final class DatabaseServiceTests {
    // Using a class here to demonstrate `deinit` for cleanup.
    let sut: DatabaseService
    let tempDirectory: URL

    init() throws {
        // ARRANGE: Runs before EACH test in this suite.
        self.tempDirectory = FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory.appendingPathComponent(UUID().uuidString)
        try FileManager.default.createDirectory(at: tempDirectory, withIntermediateDirectories: true)
        
        let testDatabase = TestDatabase(storageURL: tempDirectory)
        self.sut = DatabaseService(database: testDatabase)
    }
    
    deinit {
        // TEARDOWN: Runs after EACH test.
        try? FileManager.default.removeItem(at: tempDirectory)
    }

    @Test func testSavingUser() throws {
        let user = User(id: "user-1", name: "Alex")
        try sut.save(user)
        #expect(try sut.loadUser(id: "user-1") != nil)
    }
}
```

### Action Items
- [ ] Convert test classes from `XCTestCase` to `struct`s (preferred for automatic state isolation) or `final class`es.
- [ ] Move `setUpWithError` logic into the suite's `init()`.
- [ ] Move `tearDownWithError` logic into the suite's `deinit` (and use a `class` or `actor` if needed).
- [ ] Define the SUT and its dependencies as `let` properties, initialized in `init()`.

## **4. Mastering Error Handling**

Go beyond `do/catch` with a dedicated, expressive API for validating thrown errors.

| Overload | Replaces... | Example & Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **`#expect(throws: (any Error).self)`**| Basic `XCTAssertThrowsError` | Verifies that *any* error was thrown. |
| **`#expect(throws: BrewingError.self)`** | Typed `XCTAssertThrowsError` | Ensures an error of a specific *type* is thrown. |
| **`#expect(throws: BrewingError.outOfBeans)`**| Specific Error `XCTAssertThrowsError`| Validates a specific error *value* is thrown. |
| **Inspecting the Thrown Error** | `do/catch` with `switch` | **Payload Introspection.** The ultimate tool for errors with associated values. The macro returns the error, which you can then inspect. <br> ```swift let thrownError = #expect(throws: BrewingError.self) { try brew(beans: 0) } guard case let .notEnoughBeans(needed) = thrownError else { Issue.record("Wrong error case"); return } #expect(needed > 0) ``` |
| **`#expect(throws: Never.self)`** | `XCTAssertNoThrow` | Explicitly asserts that a function does *not* throw. Ideal for happy-path tests. |

---

## **5. Parameterized Tests: Drastically Reduce Boilerplate**

Run a single test function with multiple argument sets to maximize coverage with minimal code. This is superior to a `for-in` loop because each argument set runs as an independent test, can be run in parallel, and failures are reported individually.

| Pattern | How to Use It & When |
|---|---|
| **Single Collection** | `@Test(arguments: [0, 100, -40])` <br> The simplest form. Pass a collection of inputs. |
| **Zipped Collections** | `@Test(arguments: zip(inputs, expectedOutputs))` <br> The most common and powerful pattern. Use `zip` to pair inputs and expected outputs, ensuring a one-to-one correspondence. |
| **Multiple Collections** | `@Test(arguments: ["USD", "EUR"], [1, 10, 100])` <br> **⚠️ Caution: Cartesian Product.** This creates a test case for *every possible combination* of arguments. Use it deliberately when you need to test all combinations. |

### Example: Migrating Repetitive Tests to a Parameterized One

**Before: The XCTest Way**
```swift
func testFlavorVanillaContainsNoNuts() {
    let flavor = Flavor.vanilla
    XCTAssertFalse(flavor.containsNuts)
}
func testFlavorPistachioContainsNuts() {
    let flavor = Flavor.pistachio
    XCTAssertTrue(flavor.containsNuts)
}
func testFlavorChocolateContainsNoNuts() {
    let flavor = Flavor.chocolate
    XCTAssertFalse(flavor.containsNuts)
}
```

**After: The Swift Testing Way using `zip`**
```swift
@Test("Flavor nut content is correct", arguments: zip(
    [Flavor.vanilla, .pistachio, .chocolate],
    [false, true, false]
))
func testFlavorContainsNuts(flavor: Flavor, expected: Bool) {
    #expect(flavor.containsNuts == expected)
}
```

---

## **6. Conditional Execution & Skipping**

Dynamically control which tests run based on feature flags, environment, or known issues.

| Trait | What It Does & How to Use It |
|---|---|
| **`.disabled("Reason")`** | **Unconditionally skips a test.** The test is not run, but it is still compiled. Always provide a descriptive reason for CI visibility (e.g., `"Flaky on CI, see FB12345"`). |
| **`.enabled(if: condition)`** | **Conditionally runs a test.** The test only runs if the boolean `condition` is `true`. This is perfect for tests tied to feature flags or specific environments. <br> ```swift @Test(.enabled(if: FeatureFlags.isNewAPIEnabled)) func testNewAPI() { /* ... */ } ``` |
| **`@available(...)`** | **OS Version-Specific Tests.** Apply this attribute directly to the test function. It's better than a runtime `#available` check because it allows the test runner to know the test is skipped for platform reasons, which is cleaner in test reports. |

---

## **7. Writing Assertions with Standard Swift**

Swift Testing's philosophy is to use plain Swift expressions for assertions. For more complex checks like unordered collections or floating-point numbers, use the power of the Swift standard library.

| Assertion Type | How to Write It |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Comparing Collections (Unordered)** | A simple `==` check on arrays fails if elements are the same but the order is different. To check for equality while ignoring order, convert both collections to a `Set`. <br><br> **Brittle:** `#expect(tags == ["ios", "swift"])` // Fails if tags are `["swift", "ios"]` <br> **Robust:** `#expect(Set(tags) == Set(["swift", "ios"]))` // Passes |
| **Floating-Point Accuracy** | Floating-point math is imprecise. `#expect(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3)` will fail. To ensure tests are robust, check that the absolute difference between the values is within an acceptable tolerance. <br><br> **Fails:** `#expect(result == 0.3)` <br> **Passes:** `#expect(abs(result - 0.3) < 0.0001)` |

---

## **8. Structure and Organization at Scale**

Use suites and tags to manage large and complex test bases.

### Suites and Nested Suites
A `@Suite` groups related tests and can be nested for a clear hierarchy. Traits applied to a suite are inherited by all tests and nested suites within it.

### Tags for Cross-Cutting Concerns
Tags associate tests with common characteristics (e.g., `.network`, `.ui`, `.regression`) regardless of their suite. This is invaluable for filtering.

1.  **Define Tags in a Central File:**
    ```swift
    // /Tests/Support/TestTags.swift
    import Testing

    extension Tag {
        @Tag static var fast: Self
        @Tag static var regression: Self
        @Tag static var flaky: Self
        @Tag static var networking: Self
    }
    ```
2.  **Apply Tags & Filter:**
    ```swift
    // Apply to a test or suite
    @Test("Username validation", .tags(.fast, .regression))
    func testUsername() { /* ... */ }

    // Run from CLI
    // swift test --filter .fast
    // swift test --skip .flaky
    // swift test --filter .networking --filter .regression

    // Filter in Xcode Test Plan
    // Add "fast" to the "Include Tags" field or "flaky" to the "Exclude Tags" field.
    ```
### Power Move: Xcode UI Integration for Tags
Xcode 16 deeply integrates with tags, turning them into a powerful organizational tool.

-   **Grouping by Tag in Test Navigator:** In the Test Navigator (`Cmd-6`), click the tag icon at the top. This switches the view from the file hierarchy to one where tests are grouped by their tags. It's a fantastic way to visualize and run all tests related to a specific feature.
-   **Test Report Insights:** After a test run, the Test Report can automatically find patterns. Go to the **Insights** tab to see messages like **"All 7 tests with the 'networking' tag failed."** This immediately points you to systemic issues, saving significant debugging time.

---

## **9. Concurrency and Asynchronous Testing**

### Async/Await and Confirmations
- **Async Tests**: Simply mark your test function `async` and use `await`.
- **Confirmations**: To test APIs with completion handlers or that fire multiple times (like delegates or notifications), use the `confirmation` global function. It wraps the entire asynchronous operation and implicitly waits.

```swift
@Test("Delegate is notified 3 times")
func testDelegateNotifications() async {
    // The test operation is wrapped in an `await confirmation` call.
    // It will automatically wait or fail if the count isn't met in time.
    await confirmation("delegate.didUpdate was called", expectedCount: 3) { confirm in
        // `confirm` is a function passed to your closure. Call it when the event happens.
        let delegate = MockDelegate {
            confirm() // Call the confirmation
        }
        let sut = SystemUnderTest(delegate: delegate)

        // The action that triggers the events happens *inside* the closure.
        sut.performActionThatNotifiesThreeTimes()
    }
}
```

### Advanced Asynchronous Patterns

#### Asserting an Event Never Happens
Use a confirmation with `expectedCount: 0` to verify that a callback or delegate method is *never* called during an operation. If `confirm()` is called, the test will fail.

```swift
@Test("Logging out does not trigger a data sync")
func testLogoutDoesNotSync() async {
    await confirmation("data sync was triggered", expectedCount: 0) { confirm in
        let mockSyncEngine = MockSyncEngine {
            // If this is ever called, the test will automatically fail.
            confirm()
        }
        let sut = AccountManager(syncEngine: mockSyncEngine)
    
        sut.logout()
    }
}
```

#### Bridging Legacy Completion Handlers
For older asynchronous code that uses completion handlers, use `withCheckedThrowingContinuation` to wrap it in a modern `async/await` call that Swift Testing can work with.

```swift
func legacyFetch(completion: @escaping (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void) {
    // ... legacy async code ...
}

@Test func testLegacyFetch() async throws {
    let data = try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
        legacyFetch { result in
            continuation.resume(with: result)
        }
    }
    #expect(!data.isEmpty)
}
```

### Controlling Parallelism
- **`.serialized`**: Apply this trait to a `@Test` or `@Suite` to force its contents to run serially (one at a time). Use this as a temporary measure for legacy tests that are not thread-safe or have hidden state dependencies. The goal should be to refactor them to run in parallel.
- **`.timeLimit`**: A safety net to prevent hung tests from stalling CI. The more restrictive (shorter) duration wins when applied at both the suite and test level.

---

## **10. Advanced API Cookbook**

| Feature | What it Does & How to Use It |
|---|---|
| **`withKnownIssue`** | Marks a test as an **Expected Failure**. It's better than `.disabled` for known bugs. The test still runs but won't fail the suite. Crucially, if the underlying bug gets fixed and the test *passes*, `withKnownIssue` will fail, alerting you to remove it. |
| **`CustomTestStringConvertible`** | Provides custom, readable descriptions for your types in test failure logs. Conform your key models to this protocol to make debugging much easier. |
| **`.bug(id: "JIRA-123")` Trait** | Associates a test directly with a ticket in your issue tracker. This adds invaluable context to test reports in Xcode and Xcode Cloud. |
| **`Test.current`** | A static property (`Test.current`) that gives you runtime access to the current test's metadata, such as its name, tags, and source location. Useful for advanced custom logging. |
| **Multiple `#expect` Calls** | Unlike XCTest where a failure might stop a test, `#expect` allows execution to continue. You can place multiple `#expect` calls in a single test to validate different properties of an object, and all failures will be reported together. There is no need for a special grouping macro. |

---

## **11. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them**

A checklist of common mistakes developers make when adopting Swift Testing.

1.  **Overusing `#require()`**
    -   **The Pitfall:** Using `#require()` for every check. This makes tests brittle and hides information. If the first `#require()` fails, the rest of the test is aborted, and you won't know if other things were also broken.
    -   **The Fix:** Use `#expect()` for most checks. Only use `#require()` for essential setup conditions where the rest of the test would be nonsensical if they failed (e.g., a non-nil SUT, a valid URL).

2.  **Forgetting State is Isolated**
    -   **The Pitfall:** Assuming that a property modified in one test will retain its value for the next test in the same suite.
    -   **The Fix:** Remember that a **new instance** of the suite is created for every test. This is a feature, not a bug! All shared setup must happen in `init()`. Do not rely on state carrying over between tests.

3.  **Accidentally Using a Cartesian Product**
    -   **The Pitfall:** Passing multiple collections to a parameterized test without `zip`, causing an exponential explosion of test cases (`@Test(arguments: collectionA, collectionB)`).
    -   **The Fix:** Be deliberate. If you want one-to-one pairing, **always use `zip`**. Only use the multi-collection syntax when you explicitly want to test every possible combination.

4.  **Ignoring the `.serialized` Trait for Unsafe Tests**
    -   **The Pitfall:** Migrating old, stateful tests that are not thread-safe and seeing them fail randomly due to parallel execution.
    -   **The Fix:** As a temporary measure, apply the `.serialized` trait to the suite containing these tests. This forces them to run one-at-a-time, restoring the old behavior. The long-term goal should be to refactor the tests to be parallel-safe and remove the trait.

---

## **12. Migrating from XCTest**

Swift Testing and XCTest can coexist in the same target, enabling an incremental migration.

### Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature | XCTest | Swift Testing |
|---|---|---|
| **Test Discovery** | Method name must start with `test...` | `@Test` attribute on any function or method. |
| **Suite Type** | `class MyTests: XCTestCase` | `struct MyTests` (preferred), `class`, or `actor`. |
| **Assertions** | `XCTAssert...()` family of functions | `#expect()` and `#require()` macros with Swift expressions. |
| **Error Unwrapping** | `try XCTUnwrap(...)` | `try #require(...)` |
| **Setup/Teardown**| `setUpWithError()`, `tearDownWithError()` | `init()`, `deinit` (on classes/actors) |
| **Asynchronous Wait**| `XCTestExpectation` and `wait(for:timeout:)` | `await confirmation(...) { ... }` block-based API. |
| **Parallelism** | Opt-in, multi-process | Opt-out, in-process via Swift Concurrency. |

### What NOT to Migrate (Yet)
Continue using XCTest for the following, as they are not currently supported by Swift Testing:
- **UI Automation Tests** (using `XCUIApplication`)
- **Performance Tests** (using `XCTMetric` and `measure { ... }`)
- **Tests written in Objective-C**

## **Appendix: Evergreen Testing Principles (The F.I.R.S.T. Principles)**

These foundational principles are framework-agnostic, and Swift Testing is designed to make adhering to them easier than ever.

| Principle | Meaning | Swift Testing Application |
|---|---|---|
| **Fast** | Tests must execute in milliseconds. | Lean on default parallelism. Use `.serialized` sparingly. |
| **Isolated**| Tests must not depend on each other. | Swift Testing enforces this by creating a new suite instance for every test. Random execution order helps surface violations. |
| **Repeatable** | A test must produce the same result every time. | Control all inputs (dates, network responses) with mocks/stubs. Reset state in `init`/`deinit`. |
| **Self-Validating**| The test must automatically report pass or fail. | Use `#expect` and `#require`. Never rely on `print()` for validation. |
| **Timely**| Write tests alongside the production code. | Use parameterized tests (`@Test(arguments:)`) to easily cover edge cases as you write code. |

# Bitwarden iOS Password Manager & Authenticator Apps Claude Guidelines

Core directives for maintaining code quality and consistency in the Bitwarden iOS project.

## Core Directives

**You MUST follow these directives at all times.**

1. **Adhere to Architecture**: All code modifications MUST follow patterns in `./../Docs/Architecture.md`
2. **Follow Code Style**: ALWAYS follow https://contributing.bitwarden.com/contributing/code-style/swift
3. **Follow Testing Guidelines**: Analyzing or implementing tests MUST follow guidelines in `./../Docs/Testing.md`.
4. **Best Practices**: Follow Swift / SwiftUI general best practices (value over reference types, guard clauses, extensions, protocol oriented programming)
5. **Document Everything**: Everything in the code requires DocC documentation except for protocol properties/functions implementations as the docs for them will be in the protocol.
6. **Dependency Management**: Use `ServiceContainer` as established in the project
7. **Use Established Patterns**: Leverage existing components before creating new ones
8. **File References**: Use file:line_number format when referencing code

## Security Requirements

**Every change must consider:**
- Zero-knowledge architecture preservation
- Proper encryption key handling (iOS Keychain)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure data storage patterns
- Threat model implications

## Workflow Practices

### Before Implementation

1. Read relevant architecture documentation
2. Search for existing patterns to follow
3. Identify affected targets and dependencies
4. Consider security implications

### During Implementation

1. Follow existing code style in surrounding files
2. Write tests alongside implementation
3. Add DocC to everything except protocol implementations
4. Validate against architecture guidelines

### After Implementation

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Verify compilation succeeds
3. Review security considerations
4. Update relevant documentation

## Anti-Patterns

**Avoid these:**
- Creating new patterns when established ones exist
- Exception-based error handling in business logic
- Direct dependency access (use DI)
- Undocumented public APIs
- Tight coupling between targets

## Communication & Decision-Making

Always clarify ambiguous requirements before implementing. Use specific questions:
- "Should this use [Approach A] or [Approach B]?"
- "This affects [X]. Proceed or review first?"
- "Expected behavior for [specific requirement]?"

Defer high-impact decisions to the user:
- Architecture/module changes, public API modifications
- Security mechanisms, database migrations
- Third-party library additions

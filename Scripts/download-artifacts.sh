# Download Artifacts Script
#
# This script downloads build artifacts from a GitHub Actions run and processes them
# for the GitHub Release upload. It requires:
#   - GitHub CLI (gh) to be installed and authenticated
#   - Two arguments:
#     1. Target path where artifacts should be downloaded
#     2. GitHub Actions run ID to download artifacts from
#
# Example usage:
#   ./download-artifacts.sh 2024.10.2 1234567890
#
# The script will:
# 1. Create the target directory if it doesn't exist
# 2. Download all artifacts from the specified GitHub Actions run
# 3. Process the artifacts by zipping them with the same name as the folder
